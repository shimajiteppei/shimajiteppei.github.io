<p>Building agents is weird. You&#8217;re not writing code that does things. You&#8217;re writing code that gives an LLM the ability to do things, and the LLM decides what to do.</p>


<aside style="background: #f8f9fa;border-left: 4px solid #007bff;padding: 1rem 1.5rem;margin: 1.5rem 0;border-radius: 4px">
<p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: 0.5rem;color: #333;font-size: 1.05rem">What is an agent?</p>
<p style="margin: 0;color: #555">An agent is an LLM that calls your functions in a loop until it decides the task is complete.</p>
</aside>


<p>That shift takes some getting used to. You give the agent the ability to read files, and it decides which files to read and when. You might expect it to start with the main file. Instead, it reads three test files first to understand the patterns. You didn&#8217;t tell it to do that. It just did.</p>



<p>So what abilities do you give it? Too many and it picks poorly. Too few and it can&#8217;t do the job. Finding that balance means trying things, observing what fails, and adjusting.</p>



<p><strong>In this blog series</strong>, we&#8217;ll explore AI agents by building a real coding agent together, starting with three basic tools and transforming the agent into a complete one over the course of the series. You&#8217;ll learn about how agents actually work, how to observe and debug their behavior, and the architectural decisions that matter. By the end, you&#8217;ll understand not just this agent, but how to build your own. All in Kotlin.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll start simple by building an agent that can navigate a codebase and make targeted changes. We&#8217;ll use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/koog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koog</a>, an open-source framework from JetBrains that handles the execution loop: sending prompts, parsing tool calls, and executing them, repeating until done. The execution loop can get complex, but we&#8217;ll start with a basic one and focus on the more interesting question: what capabilities should your agent actually have?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building the agent piece by piece</strong></h2>



<p>Before we write anything, let&#8217;s think about what we actually want. An agent that can&#8230; do what exactly?</p>



<p>Fix bugs? Write features? Refactor old code?</p>



<p>We want it to do all of those things. But what does that actually mean? It means we need an agent that can navigate a codebase and make targeted changes.</p>



<p>It needs to be able to <strong>see</strong> what files are in a project, <strong>read</strong> those files, and <strong>edit</strong> them or create new ones – three capabilities that we&#8217;ll give it through three tools.</p>


<aside style="background: #f8f9fa;border-left: 4px solid #007bff;padding: 1rem 1.5rem;margin: 1.5rem 0;border-radius: 4px">
<p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: 0.5rem;color: #333;font-size: 1.05rem">What are tools?</p>
<p style="margin: 0;color: #555">Tools are functions the LLM can call when needed. You decide which ones are present, and the LLM decides when to use them.</p>
</aside>


<p>These three tools are already built and bundled into <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/koog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koog</a>. We&#8217;ll look at how each one works, and then connect them all to GPT-5-Codex. That will give us a complete agent that can explore a codebase, read files, and make changes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Teaching it to see</strong></h3>



<p>First, we add this tool to give our agent a way to explore:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))</pre>



<p>Now it can look around to see what files exist. But here&#8217;s the thing: If you just dump a list of file paths at an agent, it doesn&#8217;t really help. The agent needs to understand the structure.</p>



<p>To help with this, the tool formats its output in two ways. First, <strong>it collapses long directory chains.</strong> JVM projects have deep package structures. A typical path might be <code>src/main/kotlin/com/example/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.kt.</code> If the tool showed every intermediate directory, the output would be cluttered with single-child directories that add no information. So when it finds a long chain of single directories, it collapses them:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">/project/src/main/kotlin/Main.kt (&lt;0.1 KiB, 20 lines)</pre>



<p>Second, <strong>when there are multiple files at the same level, it shows them as a tree</strong>:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">/project/src/main/kotlin/
  Main.kt (&lt;0.1 KiB, 20 lines)
  Utils.kt (&lt;0.1 KiB, 10 lines)</pre>



<p>Notice the file sizes and line counts are right there. Why show them?</p>



<p>Without them, you&#8217;ll run into a problem we hit.&nbsp; When we first built this, we didn&#8217;t include file sizes. The agent would explore the directory and see filenames, but have no idea about their size. So when it needed to understand a file, it would just read the entire thing.</p>



<p>Then we hit a real case: the agent tried to read<a href="https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/d998eac1e7acf04dbf6f81ebe51247c02d3adb5c/xarray/tests/test_dataset.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a Python test file that was over 7,700 lines long</a>. The LLM&#8217;s context window filled up with just that one file. When the agent tried to continue working, it had lost track of other files it had read, what it was supposed to be doing, and what changes it needed to make. The single massive file had pushed everything else out of context.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why line counts and file sizes are in the directory listing. Now, when the agent explores the codebase, it sees that <code>test_dataset.py</code> is 7,700 lines before trying to read it. It can decide to read just specific sections instead of the whole thing, or skip it entirely if it&#8217;s not relevant to the task.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reading code</strong></h3>



<p>Next, the agent needs to read files:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))</pre>



<p>See <code>JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly? </code>That’s because this tool doesn&#8217;t call <code>java.nio.file</code> APIs directly. It&#8217;s built against Koog&#8217;s <code>FileSystemProvider</code> interface.</p>



<p>Why? So you can write a tool once and use it anywhere. <code>ReadFileTool</code> just calls methods on the provider. It doesn&#8217;t care if that provider reads from your local disk, from files over SSH, or from cloud storage. If you pass it to a different provider, the tool works the same way. If you&#8217;re building your own file tools, you can implement <code>FileSystemProvider</code> for your storage backend and pass it to Koog&#8217;s file tools, and they’ll work.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re using <code>JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly</code> here. Why is it <code>ReadOnly?</code> By separating read and write permissions at the provider level, you can compose agents with different permission levels. Need an agent that only explores and analyzes code? Give it tools that use <code>ReadOnly</code> providers, and you know for certain it can&#8217;t modify anything. For this agent, we&#8217;ll add modification capabilities next. <code>EditFileTool</code> will use <code>JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite</code> instead. Clear separation means you control exactly what each agent can and can&#8217;t do.<br></p>



<p>The tool also supports line ranges:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">readFile("Main.kt", startLine = 45, endLine = 72)</pre>



<p>Remember those line counts in <code>ListDirectoryTool</code>? This is why. When the agent sees a file with thousands of lines in the directory listing, it knows to be more strategic about reading it. It might read the file in chunks, avoid rereading it multiple times, or extract specific sections. This helps prevent context exhaustion from large files like that 7,700-line Python test file example.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Modifying code</strong></h3>



<p>Now we give the agent the power to actually change things:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))</pre>



<p><code>EditFileTool</code> does find-and-replace. Give it a file path, the text to find, and what to replace it with. Simple enough.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting: Those three parameters can do different things, depending on what you pass.</p>



<p>Want to replace text? Specify the original text and the replacement:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">edit_file(
    path = "Main.kt", 
    original = "Hello World!", 
    replacement = "Hello Koog!"
)</pre>



<p>Want to delete something? Just make the replacement empty:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">edit_file(
    path = "Main.kt", 
    original = "Hello World!", 
    replacement = ""
)</pre>



<p>Want to create a whole new file? Make the original empty:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">edit_file(
    path = "Main.kt", 
    original = "", 
    replacement = "fun main() { println(\"Hello World!\") }"
)</pre>



<p>Same tool. Three different operations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning from failures</strong></h4>



<p>The tool works, but we discovered something when testing with real agents. After several edits, the file was different. The agent tried to make another edit, but the text it was looking for didn’t exist anymore. Earlier edits had changed it.</p>



<p>The tool was returning &#8220;Edit failed&#8221;. We figured the agent would re-read the file and try again. Want to guess what happened instead?</p>



<p>The agent saw &#8220;Edit failed&#8221; and thought, “Something&#8217;s wrong with this file. Maybe I don&#8217;t have permission? I&#8217;ll just create a new file with my changes!” Suddenly, there were new files everywhere. Code that should have been edited ended up in new files instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fix was simple. We just needed to tell the agent what actually went wrong. We changed the error message to <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/blob/c433b8e14c9450c5800245c36efe36021d2740b2/agents/agents-ext/src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/koog/agents/ext/tool/file/patch/TokenNormalizedPatchApplier.kt#L55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;The original text to replace was not found in the file content. Consider re-reading the file to check if the original has changed since last read&#8221;</a>. And that worked. The agents learned: “Oh, text not found, I should re-read and try again.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Putting the pieces together</strong></h2>



<p>We have three tools. Now we need to connect them to GPT-5-Codex.</p>



<p>If you were building this from scratch without a framework, you&#8217;d write an execution loop: Send a prompt to GPT-5-Codex, parse the response, check if it wants to call a tool, execute that tool, send the results back, repeat. You&#8217;d need to handle API requests, error cases, token limits, and the tool calling protocol. That’s a lot of setup and effort.</p>



<p>Here, Koog&#8217;s <code>AIAgent</code> handles that loop. You give it an LLM, tools, and instructions:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5Codex,</pre>



<p>This connects the agent to GPT-5-Codex. promptExecutor is Koog&#8217;s way of handling LLM communication. You give it an API key and model, and it takes care of the rest.</p>



<p>Now tell it about your tools:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {
        tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))
        tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))
        tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))
    },</pre>



<p><code>ToolRegistry</code> is where you list your tools. Koog takes each tool, converts it into the JSON format GPT-5-Codex expects, and handles calling them when GPT-5-Codex requests it. </p>



<p>Give it instructions:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">    systemPrompt = """
        You are a highly skilled programmer tasked with updating the provided codebase according to the given task.
        Your goal is to deliver production-ready code changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase 
        and solve given task.
    """.trimIndent(),</pre>



<p>This is the system prompt that tells the agent what its job is. Notice &#8220;updating the provided codebase&#8221;? That&#8217;s what makes the agent actually modify files instead of just explaining what should change.</p>



<p>Tell it how to run:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">    strategy = singleRunStrategy(),
    maxIterations = 100</pre>



<p>The strategy is the agent loop. <a href="https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-core/ai.koog.agents.core.agent/single-run-strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">singleRunStrategy()</a> is Koog&#8217;s built-in basic version. The agent calls tools until it decides the task is complete. We&#8217;ll explore how to write complex custom strategies in future articles, but this one works for most tasks.</p>



<p>But what if it never stops? We once had an agent read a 7,000-line file, hit the token limit, lose context, and then read the same file again – over and over. Luckily <code>maxIterations = 200</code> stopped it before burning through our API budget. After 200 steps, the agent quits. Each tool call costs 2 steps (one for the call, one for the response), so that&#8217;s 100 calls max.</p>



<p>Sometimes the agent will run for a bit, leaving you sitting there wondering if it&#8217;s working or stuck. We want to add some visibility to the agent, so we can see what it’s doing. The <code>handleEvents</code> block is how you watch what&#8217;s going on in Koog:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">{
    handleEvents {
        onToolCallStarting { ctx -&gt; println("Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args:" +
                " ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}")
        }
    }
}</pre>



<p>Koog gives you different events to hook into, like <code>onToolCallStarting</code>, <code>onToolCallFinished</code>, <code>onAgentFinished</code>, and<a href="https://docs.koog.ai/agent-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> others</a>. We&#8217;re using <code>onToolCallStarting</code> here, which runs right before each tool executes, so we can log what&#8217;s about to happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll want to tune what you log, though. The first time we did this, we printed everything. <code>EditFileTool</code> scrolled hundreds of lines past us. Then we tried just the tool name. <code>EditFileTool</code> ran three times, and we had no idea what it was editing. We print 100 characters now. You can follow what&#8217;s happening without staring at too much text.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Running our agent</strong></h2>



<p>The agent is built. Now we need a way to actually use it:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking {
    if (args.size &lt; 2) {
        println("Error: Please provide the project absolute path and a task as arguments")
        println("Usage: &lt;absolute_path&gt; &lt;task&gt;")
        return@runBlocking
    }

    val (path, task) = args
    val input = "Project path: $path\n\n$task"
    val result = agent.run(input)
    println(result)
}</pre>



<p>The agent needs to know two things: where the project lives and what to do. With this block of code, we grab both from command line arguments. If they&#8217;re missing, we show an error. Otherwise, we combine them into one input string and call <code>agent.run()</code>.</p>



<p>The agent takes over from there. It explores the project, reads files, and makes changes, looping until done. When it finishes, we print the result.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like in action:</p>


                                                <figure class="wp-block-image">
                    <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/output.gif" alt="" width="800" class="wp-image-657876"/>
                </figure>
                        


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does it work?</strong></h2>



<p>Once we had the agent running, we wanted to see what these three tools could actually accomplish. So we tested it on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark of 500 coding tasks from GitHub issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It completed around 50% of them – not bad for 50 lines of code.</p>



<p>But the agent never verifies anything. Can&#8217;t compile. Can&#8217;t run tests. It reads code and makes changes based on what it sees, but has no way to know if those changes actually work.</p>



<p>And we’ve used three tools without showing you how to build one. You know what they do, but you don&#8217;t know how they work or how to make your own.</p>



<p><strong>That&#8217;s what my colleague Bruno shows you in the next article of this series.</strong> He builds a shell execution tool from scratch so the agent can run commands, see the output, and learn from what breaks. And he walks through how Koog tools work, because 50 lines of code only matter if you can extend the agent with tools for your specific problems.</p>

<p>Key in this phase is to win the hearts and minds of skeptical Java developers. Hard and soft factors can make the difference here:</p>



<p>Hard factors: the code</p>



<ul>
<li>Let the code speak</li>
</ul>



<p>Soft factors: support and connect developers</p>



<ul>
<li>Facilitate easy onboarding</li>



<li>Offer self-study material</li>



<li>Establish an in-house Kotlin community</li>



<li>Be patient…</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let the code speak</strong></h3>



<p>Double down on the experience you gained by (re-)writing an application in Kotlin and show the benefits in a tangible, accessible way:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Show, don’t tell</strong>: present the gained conciseness of Kotlin by comparing Java with Kotlin snippets.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Zoom out to focus on the overarching paradigms</strong>: Kotlin is not just <em>different</em> from Java: Kotlin is built on the foundation of safety, conciseness for maximal readability and maintainability, functions as a first-class citizen, and extensibility, which together solve fundamental shortcomings of Java, while still being fully interoperable with the Java ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here are some tangible examples:</p>



<p><strong>1. Null-safety: No more billion-dollar mistakes&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//This is why we have the billion-dollar mistake (not only in Java…)
Booking booking = null; //🤨 This is allowed but causes:
booking.destination; //Runtime error 😱

Optional&lt;Booking> booking = null; //Optionals aren’t safe from null either: 🤨
booking.map(Destination::destination); //Runtime error 😱</pre>



<p>Java has added some null-safety features over time, like Optional and Annotations (<code>@NotNull</code> etc.), but it has failed to solve this fundamental problem. Additionally, project <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valhalla</a> (Null-Restricted and Nullable types) will not introduce null-safety to Java, but rather provide more options to choose from.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Important to realize that null is very restricted in Kotlin:
val booking:Booking? = null //…null can only be assigned to Nullable types ✅ 
val booking:Booking = null //null assigned to a Non-nullable types yields a Compilation error 😃 

booking.destination //unsafely accessing a nullable type directly causes a Compilation error 😃
booking?.destination //only safe access is possible  ✅</pre>



<p>The great thing about Kotlin’s null-safety is that it is not only safe, but also offers great usability. A classic example of “have your cake and eat it, too”:</p>



<p>Say we have this Domain:</p>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data class Booking(val destination:Destination? = null)
data class Destination(val hotel:Hotel? = null)
data class Hotel(val name:String, val stars:Int? = null)</pre>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public record Booking(Optional&lt;Destination> destination) {

   public Booking() { this(Optional.empty()); }

   public Booking(Destination destination) {
       this(Optional.ofNullable(destination));
   }
}

public record Destination(Optional&lt;Hotel> hotel) {

   public Destination() { this(Optional.empty()); }

   public Destination(Hotel hotel) {
       this(Optional.ofNullable(hotel));
   }
}

public record Hotel(String name, Optional&lt;Integer> stars) {

   public Hotel(String name) {

       this(name, Optional.empty());

   }

   public Hotel(String name, Integer stars) {
       this(name, Optional.ofNullable(stars));
   }
}</pre>



<p><strong>Constructing objects</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Because Optional is a wrapper, the number of nested objects grows, which doesn’t help readability
final Optional&lt;Booking> booking = Optional.of(new Booking(
      Optional.of(new Destination(Optional.of(
            new Hotel("Sunset Paradise", 5))))));</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Since nullability is part of the type system, no wrapper is needed: The required type or null can be used. 
val booking:Booking? = Booking(Destination(Hotel("Sunset Paradise", 5)))</pre>



<p><strong>Traversing nested objects</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//traversing a graph of Optionals requires extensive unwrapping
final var stars = "*".repeat(booking
                          .flatMap(Booking::getDestination)
                          .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)
                          .map(Hotel::getStars).orElse(0)); //-> "*****"</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Easily traverse a graph of nullable types with: ‘?’, use  ?: for the ‘else’ case.
val stars = "*".repeat(booking?.destination?.hotel?.stars ?: 0) //-> "*****"</pre>



<p><strong>Unwrap nested object</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//extensive unwrapping is also needed for printing a leaf 
booking.getDestination()
       .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)
       .map(Hotel::getName)
       .map(String::toUpperCase)
         .ifPresent(System.out::println);</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//In Kotlin we have two elegant options:
//1. we can again traverse the graph with ‘?’
booking?.destination?.hotel.?name?.uppercase()?.also(::println)

//2. We can make use of Kotlin’s smart-cast feature
if(booking?.destination?.hotel != null) {
   //The compiler has checked that all the elements in the object graph are not null, so we can access the elements as if they were non-nullable types
   println(booking.destination.hotel.uppercase())
}</pre>



<p>The lack of null-safety support in Java is a key pain-point for developers, leading to defensive programming, different nullability constructs (or none at all), including increased verbosity. Moreover, NullPointerExceptions are responsible for roughly one-third of application crashes (<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/11/productive-server-side-development-with-kotlin-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The JetBrains Blog</a>). Kotlin&#8217;s compile-time null checking prevents these runtime failures entirely. That’s why, still today, <strong>Null-safety is the primary driver for migration to Kotlin</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>2. Collections are your friend, not your enemy</strong></p>



<p>The creator of Spring, Rod Johnson, stated in a recent interview that it was not Nullable-types that made him try out Kotlin, but the overly complicated Java Streams API: <a href="https://youtu.be/Rx3XZoqbi78?t=1018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creator of Spring: No desire to write Java</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following example depicts the various reasons why the Java Streams API is so horribly complicated and how Kotlin solves all of the issues:</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public record Product(String name, int... ratings){}
List&lt;Product> products = List.of(
  new Product("gadget", 9, 8, 7), 
  new Product("goody", 10, 9)
);

Map&lt;String, Integer> maxRatingsPerProduct =

   //🤨 1. Stream introduces indirection
   products.stream()
     //🤨 1. Always to and from Stream conversion
      .collect(
        //🤨 2. Lacks extension methods, so wrappers are required
        Collectors.groupingBy(
           Product::name,
            //🤨 2. Again…
           Collectors.mapping( groupedProducts ->
                //🤨 3. (too) low-level types, arrays, and primitives cause extra complexity
                //🤨 4. No API on Array, always wrap in stream 
               Arrays.stream(groupedProducts.ratings())
                   .max()
                      //🤨 5. Extra verbosity due to Optional
                      .orElse(0.0),
               //🤨 6. No named arguments: what does this do?
                Collectors.reducing(0, Integer::max)
              )
            ));</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//😃 rich and uniform Collection API - even on Java collections - due to extension methods
val maxRatingsPerProduct = products.
      .groupBy { it.name }
      .mapValues { (_, groupedProducts) -> //😃 destructuring for semantic precision
            //😃 built-in nullability support, and the same API for 
            //arrays like other Collections
            groupedProducts.flatMap { it.ratings }
                  .maxOrNull() ?: 0 
            }
      }</pre>



<p>Due to Kotlin’s uniform Collection framework, converting between different collection types is very straightforward:<br><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">int[] numbers = {1, 3, 3, 5, 2};

Set&lt;Integer> unique = Arrays.stream(numbers).boxed().collect(Collectors.toSet());

Map&lt;Integer, Boolean> evenOrOdd = unique.stream()
       .collect(Collectors.toMap(
               n -> n,
               n -> n % 2 == 0));</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val numbers = arrayOf(1, 3, 3, 5, 2)

val unique: Set&lt;Int> = numbers.toSet() //😃 simply call to&lt;Collection> to do the conversion

val evenOrOdd: Map&lt;Int, Boolean> = unique.associateWith { it % 2 == 0 }</pre>



<p><strong>Net effect:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Feature-rich, intuitive Collection API:</strong> pipelines read left-to-right like English, not inside nested collector calls.</li>



<li><strong>Less boilerplate and complexity:</strong> no Collectors.groupingBy, no Stream, no Optional, no Arrays.stream.</li>



<li><strong>One mental model:</strong> whether you start with a <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Array</code>, or primitive array, you reach for the <em>same</em> collection operators.</li>



<li><strong>Performance without pain:</strong> the compiler inserts boxing/unboxing only where unavoidable; you write normal code.</li>



<li>​​<strong>Null-safety integrated: </strong>Collection API fully supports nullability with various helpers often suffixed with <code>orNull(...)</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Seamless Java-interop with idiomatic wrappers:</strong> Due to extension methods, you get the “best of both worlds” – feature-rich Collections on top of Java collections.</li>
</ul>



<p>Put simply, Kotlin lifts the everyday collection tasks – filtering, mapping, grouping etc. – into first-class, <em>composable</em> functions, so you express <em>what</em> you want, not the ceremony of <em>how</em> to get there.</p>



<p><strong>3. No more checked Exceptions, yet safer code in Kotlin</strong></p>



<p>Java is one of the only languages that still supports checked Exceptions. Though initially implemented as a safety feature, they have not lived up to their promise. Their verbosity, pointless catch blocks that do nothing or rethrow as an Exception as a <code>RuntimeException</code>, and their misalignment with lambdas are a few reasons why they get in the way rather than making your code safer.</p>



<p>Kotlin follows the proven paradigm used by almost all other programming languages –C#, Python, Scala, Rust, and Go – of using exceptions only for unrecoverable situations.</p>



<p>The following examples highlight the obstacles that checked Exceptions introduce into your code, without adding any safety:<br><br><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public String downloadAndGetLargestFile(List&lt;String> urls) {
   List&lt;String> contents = urls.stream().map(urlStr -> {
               Optional&lt;URL> optional;
               try {
                   optional = Optional.of(new URI(urlStr).toURL());
                   //🤨 Within lambdas checked exceptions are not supported and must always be caught...
               } catch (URISyntaxException | MalformedURLException e) {
                   optional = Optional.empty();
               }
               return optional;
           }).filter(Optional::isPresent)       //Quite a mouthful to get rid of the Optional...
           .map(Optional::get)
           .map(url -> {
               try (InputStream is = url.openStream()) {
                   return new String(is.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
               } catch (IOException e) {
                   //🤨… or re-thrown, which is annoying, I don’t really care about IOE
                   throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);
               }
           }).toList();
   //🤨 An empty List results in a NoSuchElementException, so why is it not checked? The chance that the List is empty is as high as the other two cases above...
   return Collections.max(contents);
}</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//😃 safe return type
fun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List&lt;String>): String? =
   urls.mapNotNull {    //😃 convenient utility methods to rid of null
       //😃 try catch is possible, yet runCatching is an elegant way to convert an exception to null
       runCatching { URI(it).toURL() }.getOrNull()
   }.maxOfOrNull{  //😃 safe way to retrieve the max value
       it.openStream().use{ it.reader().readText() }  //😃 convenient extension methods to make java.io streams fluent
   }</pre>



<p><strong>4. Functions as first-class citizens</strong></p>



<p>Kotlin treats functions as first-class citizens, which may raise questions if you’re coming from Java: What does that mean, and why does it matter?</p>



<p>The key difference lies in Java’s limited approach – its functional capabilities focus mostly on the call-site via lambdas, while the declaration-side remains tied to verbose and less intuitive functional interfaces. In Kotlin, you can define, pass, return, and compose functions without any boilerplate, making functional programming far more expressive and natural.</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void doWithImage(
      URL url, 
      //🤨 Function interfaces introduce an indirection: because we don’t see the signature of a Function we don’t know what a  BiConsumer does, unless we look it up
      BiConsumer&lt;String, BufferedImage> f) throws IOException {
        f.accept(url.getFile(), ImageIO.read(url));
}

//🤨 Same here
public void debug(Supplier&lt;String> f) {
   if(isDebugEnabled()) {
      logger.debug("Debug: " + f.get());
   }
}

//🤨 calling no-argument lambdas is verbose
debug(() -> "expensive concat".repeat(1000));</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun doWithImage(
   url: URL,
  //😃 Kotlin has a syntax for declaring functions: from the signature, we see what goes in and what goes out 
   f:(String, BufferedImage) -> Unit) = 
      f(url.file, ImageIO.read(url))

  //😃 same here: nothing goes in, a String goes out
fun debug(msg: () -> String) {
   if(isDebugEnabled) {
            logger.debug(msg())
   }
}

//😃 convenient syntax to pass a lambda: {&lt;lambda body>}
debug{"expensive concat".repeat(1000)}</pre>



<p>Kotlin provides a clear and concise syntax for declaring functions – just from the signature, you can immediately see what goes in and what comes out, without having to navigate to an external functional interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Java “leaks” its functional programming features through a large set of <code>java.util.function.*</code> interfaces with verbose and complex signatures, which often makes functional programming cumbersome to use. Kotlin, by contrast, treats functions as first-class citizens: these interfaces remain hidden from the developer, yet remain fully interoperable with Java’s approach:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="804" height="708" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-16.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655829" style="aspect-ratio:1.1355932203389831;width:510px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>As a result, using functions in Kotlin is significantly more straightforward and intuitive, which lowers the threshold considerably for leveraging this powerful programming concept in your own code.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. Headache-free concurrency with coroutines</strong></p>



<p>If you need high throughput, parallel processing within a single request, or streaming, the only option you have in Java is a reactive library, like Reactor and RxJava, available in frameworks like Spring WebFlux, Vert.X, Quarkus etc.</p>



<p>The problem with these libraries is that they are notoriously complicated, forcing you into functional programming. As such, they have a steep learning curve, yet it is very easy to make errors that can have dire consequences when the application is under load. That’s most probably why reactive programming never became mainstream.&nbsp;</p>


                    <div class="alert ">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> VirtualThreads are not a replacement for reactive libraries, even though there is some overlap. VirtualThreads offer non-blocking I/O, but do not provide features such as parallel processing or reactive streams. Structured concurrency and Scoped Values will also enable parallel processing once the major frameworks have support for it. For reactive streams, you will always have to rely on a reactive library.<br />
</p>
        </div>
    






<p>So let’s assume you are a Java developer using Spring Boot and you want to make a parallel call within a single request. This is what you end up with:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@PostMapping("/users")
@ResponseBody
@Transactional
public Mono&lt;User> storeUser(@RequestBody User user) {
   Mono&lt;URL> avatarMono = avatarService.randomAvatar();
   Mono&lt;Boolean> validEmailMono = emailService.verifyEmail(user.getEmail());
   //🤨 what does ‘zip’ do?
   return Mono.zip(avatarMono, validEmailMono).flatMap(tuple -> 
       if(!tuple.getT2()) //what is getT2()? It’s the validEmail Boolean…
        //🤨 why can I not just throw an exception?
         Mono.error(new InvalidEmailException("Invalid Email"));
       else personDao.save(UserBuilder.from(user)
                                          .withAvatarUrl(tuple.getT1()));
     );  
  }</pre>



<p>Even though, from a runtime perspective, this code performs perfectly well, the accidental complexity introduced is enormous:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>The code is dominated by <code>Mono/Flux</code>-es, throughout the whole call chain, which enforces you to wrap all domain objects.</li>



<li>There are many complex operators everywhere, like <code>zip</code>, <code>flatMap</code>, etc.</li>



<li>You cannot use standard programming constructs like throwing exceptions&nbsp;</li>



<li>The business intent of your code suffers significantly: the code focuses on <code>Monos</code> and <code>flatMap</code>, thereby obscuring what is truly happening from a business perspective.</li>
</ul>



<p>The good news is that there is a powerful remedy in the form of Kotlin Coroutines. Coroutines can be framed as a reactive implementation on the language level. As such, they combine the best of both worlds:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>You write sequential code like you did before.</li>



<li>The code is executed asynchronously / in parallel at runtime.</li>
</ul>



<p>The above Java code converted to coroutines looks as follows:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@GetMapping("/users")
@ResponseBody
@Transactional
suspend fun storeUser(@RequestBody user:User):User = coroutineScope {
   val avatarUrl = async { avatarService.randomAvatar() }
   val validEmail = async { emailService.verifyEmail() }
   if(!validEmail.await()) throw InvalidEmailException("Invalid email")
   personRepo.save(user.copy(avatar = avatarUrl.await()))
}</pre>



<p>Kotlin’s suspend keyword enables structured, non-blocking execution in a clear and concise manner. Together with <code>async{}</code> and <code>await()</code>, it facilitates parallel processing without the need for deeply nested callbacks or complex constructs such as <code>Mono</code> or <code>CompletableFuture</code>.</p>



<p>That’s why complexity will decrease, and developer joy and maintainability will increase, with the exact same performance characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1566" height="456" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-17.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655845"/></figure>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all major Java-based web frameworks support Coroutines as well. Spring does an excellent job, as does Micronaut. Quarkus currently offers limited Coroutine support.</p>



<p><strong>6. But hey, Java is evolving too!</strong></p>



<p>Java keeps moving forward with features like records, pattern matching, and upcoming projects such as Amber, Valhalla, and Loom. This steady evolution strengthens the JVM and benefits the entire ecosystem.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: most of these “new” Java features are things Kotlin developers have enjoyed for years. Null safety, value classes, top-level functions, default arguments, concise collections, and first-class functions are all baked into Kotlin’s design – delivered in a more unified and developer-friendly way. That’s why Kotlin code often feels cleaner, safer, and far more productive.</p>



<p>And there is more: Kotlin also profits from Java’s innovation. JVM-level advances like Virtual Threads and Loom in general, or Valhalla’s performance boosts apply seamlessly to Kotlin too.</p>



<p>In short: Java evolves, but Kotlin was designed from day one to give developers the modern tools they need – making it a safe, modern, and forward-looking choice for building the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1698" height="1780" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kotlin-castle-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655858"/></figure>



<p><strong>7. Kotlin&#8217;s evolutionary advantage</strong></p>



<p>Older programming languages inevitably carry legacy baggage compared to modern alternatives. Updating a language while supporting massive existing codebases presents unique challenges for language designers. Kotlin enjoys two crucial advantages:</p>



<p><strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong>: Rather than reinventing the wheel, Kotlin&#8217;s initial design team gathered proven paradigms from major programming languages and unified them into a cohesive whole. This approach maximized evolutionary learning from the broader programming community.</p>



<p><strong>Learning from Java&#8217;s shortcomings</strong>: Kotlin&#8217;s designers could observe Java&#8217;s pitfalls and develop solid solutions from the ground up.</p>



<p>For deeper insights into Kotlin&#8217;s evolution, Andrey Breslav from Kotlin&#8217;s original design team gave an excellent talk at KotlinDevDay Amsterdam: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z_K-hTTeqI&amp;ab_channel=Xebia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shoulders of Giants: Languages Kotlin Learned From</em> – Andrey Breslav</a></p>



<p><strong>Soft factors: Support and connect developers in their Kotlin adoption journey</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Facilitate easy onboarding</strong></h3>



<p>The goal of the expressive Java vs. Kotlin code snippets is to whet the appetite for Kotlin. Code alone, however, is not enough to win the hearts and minds of Java developers. To accelerate adoption and ensure a smooth start, provide:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sample project</strong>: A ready-to-run project with both Java and Kotlin code side-by-side, giving teams a practical reference during migration.<br></li>



<li><strong>Built-in quality checks</strong>: Preconfigured with tools like SonarQube, ktlint, and detekt to promote clean, consistent, and maintainable code from day one. This will enable you to apply consistent lint rules, testing frameworks, libraries, and CI pipelines to reduce friction across teams.<br></li>



<li><strong>Coaching and support</strong>: Experienced Kotlin engineers available to coach new teams, answer questions, and provide hands-on advice during the early stages of development.
<ul>
<li>This one is particularly important: with only a few hours of guidance from an experienced developer from another team who has gone through these stages before, much damage and technical debt can be prevented.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>A bit of support and coaching is the most powerful way to nurture lasting enthusiasm for Kotlin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Offer (self-)study material</strong></h3>



<p>Especially when coming from Java, learning the Kotlin basics can be done on your own. Providing some resources upfront eases the path to getting productive with Kotlin and lowers the threshold.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>JetBrains “Tour of Kotlin” (Get Started guide)</strong><br></a>A short, browser-based tutorial on the official Kotlin site.</li>



<li><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/koans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kotlin Koans<br></strong></a>A set of bite-sized coding challenges maintained by JetBrains.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Udacity “Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers”</strong><br></a>A full video-based course created in partnership with Google.</li>
</ul>


                    <div class="alert ">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although self-study is valuable for grasping the basics, it also has some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is an optionality: being caught up in the day&#8217;s frenzy, it&#8217;s tempting to skip self-study. Moreover, you will lack feedback from a practitioner who knows the subtle nuances of correctly applied idiomatic Kotlin. There is a big chance that after a self-study course, you will write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits but does not unlock the full potential of the language. </p>
        </div>
    






<p>Unless you don’t have good coaching, a classical course can be very beneficial. There is a need to attend; you can exchange with peers of the same level and have your questions answered by an experienced professional, which will get you up to speed much faster with less non-idiomatic Kotlin during the initial transition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Establish an in-house Kotlin community</strong></h3>



<p>One of the fastest ways to level up Kotlin expertise across your company is to create and foremost nurture an in-house community.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Launch an internal Kotlin community</strong>
<ul>
<li>First look for a core-team of at least 3–6 developers who are willing to invest in a Kotlin community. Also ensure they get time and credits from their managers for their task.</li>



<li>Once the team is formed, organize a company-wide kick-off with well-known speakers from the Kotlin community. This will ignite the Kotlin flame and give it momentum.</li>



<li>Schedule regular meet-ups (monthly or bi-weekly) so momentum never drops.</li>



<li>Create a shared chat channel/wiki where questions, code snippets, and event notes live.<br></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Invite (external) speakers</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bring in engineers who’ve shipped Kotlin in production to share candid war stories.</li>



<li>Alternate between deep-dive technical talks (coroutines, KMP, functional programming) and higher-level case studies (migration strategies, tooling tips).<br></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Present lessons learned from other in-house projects</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ask project leads to present their Kotlin learnings – what worked, what didn’t, and measurable outcomes.</li>



<li>These insights can be captured in a “Kotlin playbook” that new teams can pick up.<br></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Give your own developers the stage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Run lightning-talk sessions where anyone can demo a neat trick, library, or failure they overcame in 5–10 minutes.</li>



<li>Celebrate contributors publicly – shout-outs in all-hands or internal newsletters boost engagement and knowledge-sharing.<br></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Keep feedback loops tight</strong>
<ul>
<li>After each session, collect quick polls on clarity and usefulness, then tweak future agendas accordingly.</li>



<li>Rotate organizational duties so the community doesn’t hinge on a single champion and stays resilient long-term.<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Many of the suggestions above sound straightforward. However, the effort needed to keep a community vibrant and alive should not be underestimated.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Be patient…</strong></h3>



<p>Cultural change takes time. The danger of being enthusiastic about a tool that makes a difference for you is pushing things, which can be counterproductive. An effective approach is to nurture the adoption process with all the activities discussed above, with <em>show, don’t tell</em> as prior guidance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Up next in the series</h3>



<p>We shift focus from convincing developers to persuading decision-makers. The next post shows how to build a compelling business case for Kotlin adoption, grounded in real data and measurable outcomes. You’ll learn how to translate developer wins into management arguments, link productivity gains to cost savings, and demonstrate why Kotlin is more than a technical upgrade&nbsp;<strong>–</strong>&nbsp;it’s a strategic move for teams and companies alike.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to track down a bug in concurrent programs, you know how chaotic and frustrating it can be: everything seems to work fine, then suddenly crashes, and you can’t quite pin down why – all while the bugs slip through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To bring order to this chaos, at <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://lp.jetbrains.com/research/software-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains Research</a> we built <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/Jetbrains-Research/litmuskt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LitmusKt</a> — a novel testing tool for Kotlin’s multiplatform concurrency. Designed specifically for Kotlin’s unique mix of JVM, Native, and JavaScript backends, LitmusKt helps developers uncover and eliminate subtle, platform-specific concurrency errors that traditional testing can’t catch.</p>



<p>In our <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/07/fuzzing-the-kotlin-compiler/">previous post</a>, we discussed a new approach to fuzzing the Kotlin compiler. Now we’re exploring how LitmusKt takes that work further – systematically revealing concurrency bugs hidden deep in the Kotlin runtime and compiler. In this post, we will:</p>



<ul>
<li>Talk about why concurrent programming is complex and why automated testing is particularly tricky.</li>



<li>Explain how LitmusKt was needed for the Kotlin compiler and describe its cool technical features.</li>



<li>Lay out the history of LitmusKt, from its infancy as a research prototype, some of the bugs it found, and how it is now integrated into Kotlin/Native development.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Concurrent programming</h2>



<p>When multiple tasks or computations are executed simultaneously rather than sequentially, the approach is called <em>concurrent programming</em>. Although it may sound like a simple concept, it can sometimes act erratically when implemented improperly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is so tricky, why is concurrent programming even implemented? Well, many programming problems are naturally concurrent: there are numerous tasks and external events running at the same time. Consider also how modern hardware itself is inherently concurrent, as most CPUs have multiple cores. Without concurrent code, we would not be able to use the cores to their full potential.</p>



<p>In Per Brinch Hansen’s <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3472-0_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invention of Concurrent Programming</a> (which covers the history of concurrent programming up to 2001), he tells a story where he and Peter Kraft needed to design a real-time system for a large chemical plant. For this, a computer would perform a fixed number of tasks simultaneously. The tasks’ speed could be manually adjusted by the plant operators, which means that there was no set speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they were working with simultaneous tasks and needed some sort of process synchronization. Sequential, task-independent programming wasn’t going to cut it. If you want to know what happens next, you can find it in Part I of <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3472-0_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their book</a> (spoiler: they implemented <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/4279816/344354178746665.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edsger Dijkstra’s semaphores</a>).</p>



<p>Concurrent programming provides a number of advantages, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Improved performance and throughput</strong>. More tasks are completed in a given timeframe. This is especially beneficial on multi-core processors, where different tasks can run on different cores.</li>



<li><strong>Efficient resource use</strong>, because system resources (like the CPU) can be used for other tasks while one task is waiting for input/output or another event. This reduces idle time and maximizes hardware efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Better responsiveness and user experience</strong>, because applications like web browsers, graphical user interfaces, and real-time systems remain responsive to input while other tasks run in the background. This supports smooth and uninterrupted user interactions.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges in concurrent programming</h3>



<p>When concurrent programming was first introduced in the 1960s, the operating systems running it were rather unstable. Challenges included the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>A small programming error could cause a lot of problems but be really difficult to test for and therefore fix.</li>



<li><a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~tony/OldPapers/dead.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadlocks</a>, or when all parts of a concurrent process are blocked, usually due to a lack of resources.</li>
</ul>



<p>Concurrent programming inherently involves simultaneously executed tasks. For this reason, challenges like the above arise because concurrent programming is highly dependent on unpredictable factors such as scheduling order or real-world timing. Let’s look at an example.</p>



<p>Consider a program that initializes two shared variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, with <code>0</code>, and starts two threads running in parallel. Each thread writes <code>1</code> to its associated variable. Then, each reads the other variable and stores that value as its result (<code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code>, respectively, which are also initialized with <code>0</code>).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="300" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_introweak2.png" alt="" /></p>



<p>At first glance, the outcomes for <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> seem limited and predictable. Either:</p>



<ul>
<li>One thread finishes first, so it writes <code>1</code> to <code>x</code>, reads <code>0</code> from <code>y</code>, and the other reads the updated value <code>1</code>, giving us straightforward outcomes of <code>(0, 1)</code> or <code>(1, 0)</code>, depending on which thread finished first.</li>



<li>Or both threads execute at the same time, so they both write <code>1</code>, and both read <code>1</code>, yielding another expected result: <code>(1, 1)</code>.</li>
</ul>



<p>But then, after running the program many times, a seemingly impossible outcome starts to appear: Each thread reads <code>0</code>, even though both have written <code>1</code>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="300" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_introweak.png" alt="" /></p>



<p>This sort of bizarre outcome is called <strong><mark style="background-color:#fcf84a" class="has-inline-color">weak behavior</mark></strong>. It can happen for one of two reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>Compiler optimizations, where compilers rearrange instructions or eliminate redundant memory operations to increase performance. This can result in subtle bugs, or even break the code, as dependencies may be lost in the shuffle.</li>



<li>CPU buffering and reordering, where the hardware itself may buffer, delay, or reorder reads and writes to maximize efficiency. Modern CPUs have <em>weak memory models</em> that allow operations to happen in surprising sequences, invisible in regular single-threaded programs.</li>
</ul>



<p>Weak behaviors caused by the above are a central focus in analyzing and testing concurrent programs with specialized tools. If the programmer only looks at the code or thinks in terms of simple statement interleaving, these outcomes seem impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, compiler and CPU optimizations change the story, making concurrent programming far more elusive and unpredictable than it appears at first glance. This creates headaches for programmers and those designing programming languages. Because reasoning about these subtle interactions is so challenging, <strong>thorough testing is essential to ensure reliability</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing concurrent programs</h3>



<p>Concurrent programming is difficult to test because nondeterministic thread interactions can produce subtle, non-reproducible failures. These are often called Heisenbugs, and they only appear under specific timings or schedules, making them inherently hard to find and troubleshoot. The same input can pass a test and then fail the very same test depending on subtle, uncontrollable sources of nondeterminism, and even the act of observing or debugging can mask or alter the bug’s behavior, contributing to flaky tests and prolonged debugging cycles.</p>



<p>Traditional testing approaches struggle here because listing all possible thread schedules is infeasible in practice, and even systematic methods that control scheduling to capture nondeterminism are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This challenge is compounded by state space explosion, where the number of possible interleavings grows combinatorially with threads and synchronization points, necessitating reductions such as partial-order reduction and guided exploration to avoid redundant paths.</p>



<p>For testing these notoriously tricky programs, developers use a variety of strategies. Some common ones are listed in the table below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1771" height="801" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_table-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-652894" style="width:750px"/></figure>



<p>While code review and static analysis are both useful for early detection of concurrency bugs, they come with disadvantages as well. Namely, code review is susceptible to the reviewers’ errors and knowledge gaps; static analysis can generate false positives, thereby creating more work, and can miss runtime-only errors.</p>



<p>Random/<a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/07/fuzzing-the-kotlin-compiler/">fuzz</a>/<a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://testsigma.com/blog/software-stress-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a> testing types are great for detecting rare or subtle bugs. They test programs under extreme conditions, for example with random inputs and under heavy load. These tests (especially stress testing) can also be useful to ensure smooth operation of a program in critical situations. These methods are usually resource-intensive, and they can sometimes produce false positives or miss more complex issues.</p>



<p>Many strategies work well with business logic and modest concurrency patterns, but fall short with the subtle hardware or compiler optimizations that lead to “impossible” results, like the (0,0) outcome above. For example, stress testing or fuzzing may uncover these bugs eventually, but a specific type of tests called <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:#fcf84a" class="has-inline-color">litmus tests</mark></strong></strong> is designed to systematically target these subtle behaviors and confirm theoretical predictions. This strategy is highly effective for environments with well-defined memory models, like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or specific CPUs.</p>



<p>For the rest of this post, we will concentrate on litmus testing and then tell you about a specific litmus testing tool developed by JetBrains researchers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Litmus testing</h3>



<p>Litmus testing is like stress testing for concurrency: you write small concurrent programs (i.e., litmus tests) and run them thousands of times to catch rare, weird behaviors that only happen under specific timing conditions. Established tools like <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/openjdk/jcstress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JCStress</a> for Java and <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/herd/herdtools7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herdtools</a> for assembly language have successfully found real bugs in production systems.</p>



<p><em>JCStress</em>, for instance, is used by OpenJDK developers to test the JVM, catching subtle race conditions and memory model violations that could cause catastrophic failures in production. <em>herdtools</em> goes even deeper, testing assembly-level programs against processor memory models to ensure hardware behaves as expected. While these tools are useful for the respective languages, they run into limitations with multi-platform languages like <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlin</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike other languages, a key feature of Kotlin is that it compiles to JVM, Native, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, and each platform has its own distinct concurrency semantics and memory models. This diversity means some bugs cannot be caught with tools designed for just one backend – and so far existing tools hadn&#8217;t been able to handle this complexity. In other words, <strong>Kotlin needed its own litmus testing tool</strong>.</p>



<p>We took on the challenge of helping to discover bugs in the Kotlin compiler, and the result is a new tool that makes testing these tricky programs far easier.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Testing concurrency programs with LitmusKt</h2>



<p>To overcome the lack of a proper Kotlin testing tool for concurrency programming, we  at  <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://lp.jetbrains.com/research/software-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains Research</a>) decided to build our own solution, <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/Jetbrains-Research/litmuskt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LitmusKt</a> (see <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their recent paper</a>). This section will tell you about its design and tech highlights, as well as its practical applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">LitmusKt’s design and cool technical features</h3>



<p>LitmusKt allows developers to write litmus tests once and run them across both Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native platforms. The tool uses a custom domain-specific language that makes writing tests straightforward. A few examples of what LitmusKt does:</p>



<ul>
<li>Declare shared states, such as shared variables, between threads.</li>



<li>Write thread behavior so that it’s clear what each thread should do.</li>



<li>Label expected outcomes as <em>acceptable</em>, <em>interesting</em> (i.e., noteworthy but allowed), or <em>forbidden</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>By using a custom DSL, developers can express thread interactions, shared variables, and outcome conditions flexibly, all within Kotlin. This<strong> lowers the barrier for writing complex concurrency tests</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s run through an example. Below you can find the code for the Store Buffering test, which is a standard litmus test (it’s also the program we saw in the example before). The test involves (i) defining a shared state, (ii) running code for several threads, and (iii) specifying&nbsp; test outcomes; we will go through each one step by step.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">object StoreBuffering {
 val Plain = litmusTest({
    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {
	var x = 0
	var y = 0
    }
}) {
   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }
   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }
   spec {
	accept(r1:0, r2:1)
	accept(r1:1, r2:0)
	accept(r1:1, r2:1)
	interesting(r1:0, r2:0)
   }
   reset { x = 0; y = 0 }
}</pre>



<p>First, the test itself needs to be declared: we declare the state which will eventually be shared between the threads. In the example below, this comprises two <code>int</code> variables.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">object StoreBuffering {
 val Plain = litmusTest({
    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {
	var x = 0
	var y = 0
    }</pre>



<p>Next comes the code for each thread, shown below.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">}) {
   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }
   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }</pre>



<p>Finally, we must declare the outcomes and their labels. The possible outcomes are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5e5d5d" class="has-inline-color">Acceptable</mark></strong>: sequentially consistent outcomes</li>



<li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">Interesting</mark></strong>: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language</li>
</ul>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""> spec {
	accept(r1:0, r2:1)
	accept(r1:1, r2:0)
	accept(r1:1, r2:1)
	interesting(r1:0, r2:0)
   }</pre>



<p>If you recall the example above, the result where <code>r1 = 0</code> and <code>r2 = 0</code> was unexpected, because it is <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:#fcf84a" class="has-inline-color">weak behavior</mark></strong></strong>. In the code for the test, this result will be labelled as <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">interesting</mark></strong></strong>, meaning it is acceptable but noteworthy. The other listed results are expected and therefore will be labelled as <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5e5d5d" class="has-inline-color">acceptable</mark></strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look at what happens when we run the test with LitmusKt. How often do we see weak behavior in one million tests?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="500"  src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_interesting.png" ></p>



<p>The above screenshot shows that <strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">interesting</mark></strong></strong></strong> outcomes do occur, but that they are relatively rare, at less than five percent. To increase the frequency of finding these weak but tolerable outcomes, LitmusKt enables the user to apply different parameters to increase the number of complex interactions (see the paper for further details).</p>



<p>Now that we know how to write a test in LitmusKt, let’s look at the more technical details. Our team built a custom Kotlin/Native test runner from scratch because no solutions existed up until then. The test runner is built on techniques from other litmus testing tools, such as careful thread synchronization and CPU affinity control. We created a test runner so that the threads modify different states simultaneously many times over, significantly increasing the likelihood that a concurrent interaction occurs and weak behavior can be detected.</p>



<p>For Kotlin/JVM, we integrated the tool with the existing JCStress framework, as it is known to be successful in uncovering concurrency bugs in various JVM implementations. Despite some integration challenges, the end interface is seamless for the user.</p>



<p>To summarize, LitmusKt incorporates proven methods to maximize the frequency of rare behaviors and provides powerful reporting tools for manual and automated analysis. Users can also interact via a rich command-line interface, adjusting test parameters, durations, and system settings.</p>



<p>Considering all these features, has LitmusKt caught any Kotlin bugs? As we will see in the next section, it has.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">LitmusKt and real code</h3>



<p>We applied LitmusKt and several litmus tests to analyze the behavior of Kotlin programs, therefore testing the results of the Kotlin compiler and looking for previously unknown issues. The possible outcomes here are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5e5d5d" class="has-inline-color">Acceptable</mark></strong></strong>: sequentially consistent outcomes</li>



<li><strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">Interesting</mark></strong></strong></strong>: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language</li>



<li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f01b02" class="has-inline-color">Forbidden</mark></strong>: weak intolerable outcomes, indicating bugs</li>
</ul>



<p>In contrast to the Store Buffering Test above, this analysis includes two weak outcomes: one tolerable and one intolerable, where the latter outcome represents a bug. The testing results are shown in the following image, where ACC, INT, and FORB stand for <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5e5d5d" class="has-inline-color">acceptable</mark></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">interesting</mark></strong></strong></strong>, and <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f01b02" class="has-inline-color">forbidden</mark></strong></strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="400" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_analysis.png" ></p>



<p>We can see that there are a number of tests uncovering <strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#fc801d" class="has-inline-color">interesting</mark></strong></strong></strong> results, and one test in particular with <strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f01b02" class="has-inline-color">forbidden</mark></strong></strong> </strong>results. The test abbreviated as UPUB in the table is <em>unsafe publication</em>. The forbidden results represent a situation where objects could be accessed before proper initialization, potentially causing rare and critical failures in production environments. The fact that memory-unsafe behavior could slip through in a memory-safe language like Kotlin demonstrates why <strong>systematic concurrency testing is essential</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look more closely at <em>unsafe publication</em>, shown in the code below,<em> </em>and what unexpected outcomes arose.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class IntHolder(val x: Int = 0)
 val UnsafePublication = litmusTest({
    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {
	var h : IntHolder? = null
    }
}) {
   thread { h = IntHolder() }
   thread { r1 = h?.x ?: -1 }
   spec { accept(0); accept(-1) }
   reset { h = null }
}</pre>



<p>In the code above, we can see a simple class <code>IntHolder</code> with a single integer. The shared state is a reference to this class. Then, we have two threads: one which is going to create a new class, and one which will try to read its variable.</p>



<p>The outcome of running the <em>unsafe publication</em> test was expected to be one of two scenarios:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>The class <code>IntHolder</code> is initialized —&gt; <code>0</code></li>



<li>The class <code>IntHolder</code> is not initialized —&gt; <code>-1</code></li>
</ol>



<p>The actual outcome of running the <em>unsafe publication</em> test with Kotlin 1.9 is shown in the following image. Any result which is not declared as interesting or acceptable is considered <strong><strong><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f01b02" class="has-inline-color">forbidden</mark></strong></strong></strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="500" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_forbidden-1.png" ></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, garbage values could be read from uninitialized memory. A memory-safe language like Kotlin definitely should not let this happen. In other words, <strong>our team found a new compiler bug thanks to LitmusKt</strong>. Since identifying the bug, our team has already <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/d2e0361b4e6de7e804c6c079e7195354cd77ced9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed</a> and merged it. As of Kotlin 1.9.20 and later, this bug no longer occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found further issues while running <em>unsafe publication</em> with LitmusKt (see <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a> for more details). As these are valuable insights for the Kotlin compiler, and after discussion with the Kotlin/Native development team, <a style="color:#6B57FF;" href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/c409279a3833105caf9a4c18c479358c14293ad7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LitmusKt is now embedded in the Kotlin CI/CD pipeline</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the issues arising from running different tests, we discovered more noteworthy outcomes. The below image contains the partial code of a standard litmus test and the resulting outcomes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="550" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_noweak_horiz.png" ></p>



<p>As can be seen in the above image, the test produces only three outcomes. So far, nothing crazy. The interesting bit happens when the code is slightly altered with semantically equivalent changes. That is, these changes theoretically should not result in any additional thread interactions. However, as the below image shows, another outcome actually does show up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="550" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LitmusKt_semanticchange_horiz.png" ></p>



<p>This extra outcome, marked in pink in the above image, is actually a <strong><mark style="background-color:#fcf84a" class="has-inline-color">weak outcome</mark></strong>, as it cannot be achieved by interleaving execution of threads. We suspect that such behavior is caused by compiler optimizations. In the future, it might be worthwhile to combine compiler fuzzing (i.e., with random code mutations) with litmus testing to discover more edge cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bringing order to Kotlin concurrency</h2>



<p>LitmusKt proves that even in the mayhem of concurrent programming, order can be found. By catching bugs that once slipped through the cracks of the Kotlin compiler, it has made multiplatform Kotlin development more reliable than ever.</p>



<p>With LitmusKt now part of Kotlin’s CI pipeline, every new compiler version benefits from systematic concurrency testing – ensuring that subtle memory model violations are caught before they reach developers.</p>



<p>We didn’t just build a tool; we established a new way to think about concurrency testing for multiplatform languages.</p>



<p>In short, LitmusKt:</p>



<ul>
<li>Brings automated, multiplatform litmus testing to Kotlin for the first time.</li>



<li>Uncovered and helped fix multiple concurrency bugs in Kotlin/Native.</li>



<li>Opened new possibilities for hybrid testing approaches that combine compiler fuzzing with concurrency analysis.</li>
</ul>



<p>LitmusKt is open-source and ready to help you explore, understand, and test the complex behaviors of concurrent programs across Kotlin’s many platforms.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Evaluation Stage: Beyond Kotlin as a Playground</strong></h2>



<p>Once you&#8217;re comfortable with Kotlin in tests, it&#8217;s time for a more substantial evaluation. You have two main approaches:</p>

</div>



<p>This is how you can avoid common pitfalls when using Kotlin from a Java background:</p>



<p><em>Pitfall: Choosing a different framework from the one you use in Java.</em></p>



<p>Tip: <strong>Stick to your existing framework</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most likely, you were using Spring Boot with Java, so use it with Kotlin too. Spring Boot Kotlin support is first-class, so there is no additional benefit in using something else. Moreover, you are forced to learn not only a new language but also a new framework, which only adds complexity without providing any advantage.<br><br><strong>Important</strong>: Spring interferes with Kotlin’s ‘inheritance by design’ principle, which requires you to explicitly mark classes open in order to extend them.<br><br>In order to avoid adding the open keyword to all Spring-related classes (like <code>@Configuration</code>, etc.), use the following build plugin: <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html#spring-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html#spring-support</a>. If you create a Spring project with the well-known online <a href="https://start.spring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring initializr tool</a>, this build plugin is already configured for you.</p>



<p><em>Pitfall: Writing Kotlin in a Java-ish way, relying on common Java APIs rather than Kotlin’s standard library:</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>This list can be very long, so let’s focus on the most common pitfalls:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 1: Using Java Stream rather than Kotlin Collections</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Always use Kotlin Collections.</strong></p>



<p>Kotlin Collections are fully interoperable with Java Collections, yet equipped with straightforward and feature-rich higher-order functions that make Java Stream obsolete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As follows is an example that aims to pick the top 3 products by revenue (price * sold) grouped by product category:</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">record Product(String name, String category, double price, int sold){}

List&lt;Product> products = List.of(
           new Product("Lollipop", "sweets", 1.2, 321),
           new Product("Broccoli", "vegetable", 1.8, 5);

Map&lt;String, List&lt;Product>> top3RevenueByCategory =
       products.stream()
          .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                Product::category,
                Collectors.collectingAndThen(
                    Collectors.toList(),
                    list -> list.stream()
                              .sorted(Comparator.comparingDouble(
                                  (Product p) -> p.price() * p.sold())
                                   .reversed())
                                   .limit(3)
                                   .toList()
                       		)
          )
);</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val top3RevenueByCategory: Map&lt;String, List&lt;Product>> =
   products.groupBy { it.category }
       .mapValues { (_, list) ->
           list.sortedByDescending { it.price * it.sold }.take(3)
       }</pre>



<p>Kotlin Java interop lets you work with Java classes and records as if they were native Kotlin, though you could also use a Kotlin (data) class instead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 2: Keeping on using Java’s Optional.</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Embrace Nullable types</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the key reasons Java developers switch to Kotlin is for Kotlin’s built-in nullability support, which waves NullPointerExceptions goodbye. Therefore, try to use Nullable types only, no more Optionals. Do you still have Optionals in your interfaces? This is how you easily get rid of them by converting them to Nullable types:</p>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Let’s assume this repository is hard to change, because it’s a library you depend on
class OrderRepository {
      //it returns Optional, but we want nullable types
      fun getOrderBy(id: Long): Optional&lt;Order> = …
}

//Simply add an extension method and apply the orElse(null) trick
fun OrderRepository.getOrderByOrNull(id: Long): Order? = 
                                    getOrderBy(id).orElse(null)

//Now enjoy the safety and ease of use of nullable types:

//Past:
 val g = repository.getOrderBy(12).flatMap { product ->
     product.goody.map { it.name }
}.orElse("No goody found")

//Future:
 val g = repository.getOrderByOrNull(12)?.goody?.name ?: "No goody found"</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 3: Continuing to use static wrappers.</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Embrace Extension methods</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extension methods give you many benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>They make your code much more fluent and readable than wrappers.</li>



<li>They can be found with code completion, which is not the case for wrappers.</li>



<li>Because Extensions need to be imported, they allow you to selectively use extended functionality in a specific section of your application.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Very common approach in Java to add additional helper methods
public class DateUtils {
      public static final DateTimeFormatter DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER = 
           DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");

      public String formatted(LocalDateTime dateTime, 
		              DateTimeFormatter formatter) {
         return dateTime.format(formatter);
      }

      public String formatted(LocalDateTime dateTime) {
         return formatted(dateTime, DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER);
      }
}

//Usage
 formatted(LocalDateTime.now());
</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER: DateTimeFormatter = 
DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

//Use an extension method, including a default argument, which omits the need for an overloaded method. 
fun LocalDateTime.asString(
   formatter: DateTimeFormatter = DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER): String = 
      this.format(formatter)

//Usage
LocalDateTime.now().formatted()</pre>



<p>Be aware that Kotlin offers top-level methods and variables. This implies that we can simply declare e.g. the <em><code>DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER</code></em> top level without the need to bind to an object like is the case in Java.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 4: Relying on (clumsily) Java APIs</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Use Kotlin’s slick counterpart.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Kotlin standard library uses extension methods to make Java libraries much more user-friendly, even though the underlying implementation is still Java. Almost all major third-party libraries and frameworks, like Spring, have done the same.</p>



<p><strong>Example standard library:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">String text;
try (
       var reader = new BufferedReader(
                  new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("out.txt"), 
            StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
   text = reader
            .lines()
            .collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));
}
System.out.println("Downloaded text: " +  text + "\n");</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Kotlin has enhanced the Java standard library with many powerful extension methods, like on java.io.*, which makes input stream processing a snap due to its fluent nature, fully supported by code completion

val text = FileInputStream("path").use {
             it.bufferedReader().readText()
           }
println("Downloaded text: $text\n");</pre>



<p><strong>Example Spring:</strong><br><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">final var books =  RestClient.create()
       .get()
       .uri("http://.../api/books")
       .retrieve()
       .body( new ParameterizedTypeReference&lt;List&lt;Book>>(){}); // ⇦ inconvenient ParameterizedTypeReference</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">import org.springframework.web.client.body
val books = RestClient.create()
   .get()
   .uri("http://.../api/books")
   .retrieve()
   .body&lt;List&lt;Book>>() //⇦ Kotlin offers an extension that only requires the type without the need for a ParameterizedTypeReference</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 5: Using a separate file for each public class</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Combine related public classes in a single file.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This allows you to get a good understanding of how a (sub-)domain is structured without having to navigate dozens of files.<br><br><strong>Java</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1114" height="934" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-15.png" alt="" class="wp-image-647331"/></figure>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//For domain classes consider data classes - see why below
data class User(val email: String,

           var isEmailVerified: Boolean)

data class Account(val user:User,

              val createdAt: Instant)

data class Address(val street: String,
              val city: String,
              val postalCode: String)</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 6: Relying on the mutable programming paradigm</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Embrace immutability – the default in Kotlin</strong></p>



<p>The trend across many programming languages – including Java – is clear: immutability is winning over mutability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason is straightforward: immutability prevents unintended side effects, making code safer, more predictable, and easier to reason about. It also simplifies concurrency, since immutable data can be freely shared across threads without the risk of race conditions.</p>



<p>That’s why most modern languages – Kotlin among them – either emphasize immutability by default or strongly encourage it. In Kotlin, immutability is the default, though mutability remains an option when truly needed.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide to Kotlin’s <strong>immutability power pack</strong>:</p>



<p>1. Use <code>val</code> over <code>var</code></p>



<p>Prefer <code>val</code> over <code>var</code>. IntelliJ IDEA will notify you if you used a <code>var</code>, for which a <code>val</code> could be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Use (immutable) data classes with <code>copy(...)</code></p>



<p>For domain-related classes, use <code>data</code> classes with <code>val</code>. Kotlin <code>data</code> classes are often compared with Java <code>records</code>. Though there is some overlap, <code>data</code> classes offer the killer feature <code>copy(...)</code>, whose absence makes transforming <code>record</code> – which is often needed in business logic – so tedious:</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//only immutable state
public record Person(String name, int age) {
   //Lack of default parameters requires overloaded constructor
   public Person(String name) { 
       this(name, 0);
   }
   //+ due to lack of String interpolation
  public String sayHi() {
       return "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
   }
}

//Usage
final var jack = new Person("Jack", 42);
jack: Person[name=Jack, age=5]

//The issue is here: transforming a record requires manually copying the identical state to the new instance ☹️
final var fred = new Person("Fred", jack.age());</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//also supports mutable state (var)
data class Person(val name: String,
                  val age: Int = 0) {
  //string interpolation
  fun sayHi() = "Hi, my name is $name and I am $age years old."
}
val jack = Person("Jack", 42)
jack: Person(name=Jack, age=42)

//Kotlin offers the copy method, which, due to the ‘named argument’ feature, allows you to only adjust the state you want to change 😃
val fred = jack.copy(name = "Fred")
fred: Person(name=Fred, age=42)</pre>



<p>Moreover, use data classes for domain-related classes whenever possible. Their immutable nature ensures a safe, concise, and hassle-free experience when working with your application’s core.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tip: <strong>Prefer Immutable over Mutable Collections</strong></p>



<p>Immutable Collections have clear benefits regarding thread-safety, can be safely passed around, and are easier to reason about. Although Java collections offer some immutability features for Collections, their usage is dangerous because it easily causes exceptions at runtime:</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">List.of(1,2,3).add(4); //❌unsafe 😬! .add(...) compiles, but throws UnsupportedOperationException</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//The default collections in Kotlin are immutable (read-only)
listOf(1,2,3).add(4);  //✅safe: does not compile

val l0 = listOf(1,2,3) 
val l1 = l0 + 4 //✅safe: it will return a new list containing the added element
l1 shouldBe listOf(1,2,3,4) //✅</pre>



<p>The same applies for using <code>Collections.<em>unmodifiableList(...)</em></code><em>, </em>which is not only unsafe, but also requires extra allocation:</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class PersonRepo {
   private final List&lt;Person> cache = new ArrayList&lt;>();
   // Java – must clone or wrap every call
   public List&lt;Person> getItems() {
       return Collections.unmodifiableList(cache);   //⚠️extra alloc
   }
}

//Usage
personRepo.getItems().add(joe) //❌unsafe 😬! .add(...) can be called but throws UnsupportedOperationException</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class PersonRepo {

//The need to type ‘mutable’ for mutable collections is intentional: Kotlin wants you to use immutable ones by default. But sometimes you need them:

   private val cache: MutableList&lt;Person> = mutableListOf&lt;Person>()

   fun items(): List&lt;Person> = cache //✅safe: though the underlying collection is mutable, by returning it as its superclass List&lt;...>, it only exposes the read-only interface

}

//Usage
personRepo.items().add(joe) //✅safe:😬! Does not compile</pre>



<p>When it comes to concurrency, immutable data structures, including collections, should be preferred. In Java, more effort is required with special Collections that offer a different or limited API, like <code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>. In Kotlin, on the other hand, the read-only <code>List&lt;...&gt;</code> does the job for almost all use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you need mutable, Thread-Safe Collections, Kotlin offers Persistent Collections (<code>persistentListOf(...)</code>, <code>persistentMapOf(...)</code>), which all share the same powerful interface.</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ConcurrentHashMap&lt;String, Integer> persons = new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;>();
persons.put("Alice", 23);
persons.put("Bob",   21);

//not fluent and data copying going on
Map&lt;String, Integer> incPersons = new HashMap&lt;>(persons.size());
persons.forEach((k, v) -> incPersons.put(k, v + 1));

//wordy and data copying going on
persons
   .entrySet()
   .stream()
   .forEach(entry -> 
      entry.setValue(entry.getValue() + 1));</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">persistentMapOf("Alice" to 23, "Bob" to 21)
         .mapValues { (key, value) -> value + 1 } //✅same rich API like any other Kotlin Map type and not data copying going on</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Pitfall 7: Keeping on using builders (or even worse: trying to use Lombok)&nbsp;</em></h4>



<p>Tip: <strong>Use named arguments.</strong></p>



<p>Builders are very common in Java. Although they are convenient, they add extra code, are unsafe, and increase complexity. In Kotlin, they are of no use, as a simple language feature renders them obsolete: named arguments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public record Person(String name, int age) {

   // Builder for Person
   public static class Builder {
       private String name;
       private int age;

       public Builder() {}

       public Builder name(String name) {
           this.name = name;
           return this;
       }

       public Builder age(int age) {
           this.age = age;
           return this;
       }

       public Person build() {
           return new Person(name, age);
       }
   }
}

//Usage
new JPerson.Builder().name("Jack").age(36).build(); //compiles and succeeds at runtime

new JPerson.Builder().age(36).build(); //❌unsafe 😬: compiles but fails at runtime.</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int = 0)

//Usage - no builder, only named arguments.
Person(name = "Jack") //✅safe: if it compiles, it always succeeds at runtime
Person(name = "Jack", age = 36) //✅</pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2.-extend/convert-an-existing-java-application"><strong>2. Extend/convert an existing Java application</strong></h3>



<p>If you have no greenfield option for trying out Kotlin, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/get-started-with-kotlin.html#add-kotlin-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding new Kotlin features or whole Kotlin modules to an existing Java codebase </a>is the way to go. Thanks to Kotlin&#8217;s seamless Java interoperability, you can write Kotlin code that looks like Java to Java callers. This approach allows for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gradual migration without big-bang rewrites</li>



<li>Real-world testing of Kotlin in your specific context</li>



<li>Building team confidence with production Kotlin code</li>
</ul>



<p>Rather than starting <em>somewhere</em>, consider these different approaches:</p>



<p><strong>Outside-in:</strong></p>



<p>Start in the “leaf” section of your application, e.g. controller, batch job, etc. and then work your way towards the core domain. This will give you the following advantages:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compile-time isolation</strong>: Leaf classes rarely have anything depending <em>on them</em>, so you can flip them to Kotlin and still build the rest of the system unchanged.</li>



<li><strong>Fewer ripple edits.</strong> A converted UI/controller can call existing Java domain code with almost no changes thanks to seamless interop.</li>



<li><strong>Smaller PRs, easier reviews.</strong> You can migrate file-by-file or feature-by-feature.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Inside-out:</strong></p>



<p>Starting at the core and then moving to the outer layers is often a riskier approach, as it compromises the advantages of the outside-in approach mentioned above. However, it is a viable option in the following cases:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Very small or self-contained core.</strong> If your domain layer is only a handful of POJOs and services, flipping it early may be cheap and immediately unlock idiomatic constructs (data class, value classes, sealed hierarchies).</li>



<li><strong>Re-architecting anyway.</strong> If you plan to refactor invariants or introduce DDD patterns (value objects, aggregates) while you migrate, it’s sometimes cleaner to redesign the domain in Kotlin first.</li>



<li><strong>Strict null-safety contracts.</strong> Putting Kotlin at the center turns the domain into a “null-safe fortress”; outer Java layers can still send null, but boundaries become explicit and easier to police.<br></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Module by module</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>If your architecture is organized by functionality rather than layers, and the modules have a manageable size, converting them one by one is a good strategy.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Language features for converting Java to Kotlin</strong></p>



<p>Kotlin offers a variety of features – primarily annotations – that allow your Kotlin code to behave like native Java. This is especially valuable in hybrid environments where Kotlin and Java coexist within the same codebase.<br><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class Person @JvmOverloads constructor(val name: String,
                          var age: Int = 0) {
  companion object {

  @JvmStatic
  @Throws(InvalidNameException::class)
  fun newBorn(name: String): Person = if (name.isEmpty()) 
       throw InvalidNameException("name not set")
     else Person(name, 0)

   @JvmField
   val LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(KPerson.javaClass)
  }
}</pre>



<p><strong>Java</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//thanks to @JvmOverloads an additional constructor is created, propagating Kotlin’s default arguments to Java
var john =  new Person("John");

//Kotlin automatically generates getters (val) and setters (var) for Java
john.setAge(23);
var name = ken.getName();

//@JvmStatic and @JvmField all accessing (companion) object fields and methods as statics in Java

//Without @JvmStatic it would be: Person.Companion.newBorn(...)
var ken =  Person.newBorn("Ken"); 

//Without @JvmField it would be: Person.Companion.LOG
Person.LOG.info("Hello World, Ken ;-)");

//@Throws(...) will put the checked Exception in the method signature 
try {
  Person ken =  Person.newBorn("Ken");
} catch (InvalidNameException e) {
  //…
}</pre>



<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@file:JvmName("Persons")
package org.abc

@JvmName("prettyPrint")

fun Person.pretty() =
      Person.LOG.info("$name is $age old")</pre>

Persons.prettyPrint(ken)</pre>



<p><strong>IntelliJ IDEA’s Java to Kotlin Converter</strong></p>



<p>IntelliJ IDEA offers a Java to Kotlin Converter, so theoretically, the tool can do it for you. However, the resulting code is far from perfect, so use it only as a starting point. From there, convert it to a more Kotlin-esque representation. More on this topic will be discussed in the final section of this blog post series:<em> Success Factors for Large-Scale Kotlin Adoption.</em></p>



<p>Taking Java as a starting point will most likely make you write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits, but will not unleash the power of Kotlin’s potential. Therefore, writing a new application is the approach I prefer.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Next in the series</h3>



<p>This installment in our <em>Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment</em> series of blog posts demonstrated how Kotlin experiments can evolve into production code. Our next post focuses on the human side of adoption: convincing your peers. It explains how to present clear, code-driven arguments, guide new developers, and create a small but lasting Kotlin community within your team.</p>

The JVM, one of the fastest runtime platforms, makes Java nearly as efficient as C, but Java can feel a bit verbose at times.

<p>Adopting Kotlin in an established Java environment isn&#8217;t just a technical decision – it&#8217;s a journey that requires careful planning, strategic thinking, and most importantly, winning the hearts and minds of your peers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After training over 1,000 developers and helping numerous organizations successfully transition to Kotlin, I&#8217;ve seen what works and what doesn&#8217;t. This guide will walk you through successful recipes for adopting Kotlin, which I have collected over time, from your first experimental playground to large-scale organizational transformation.</p>



<p>This is the journey this series will take you through:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It Always Starts With a Spark, Initiated by You!</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1586" height="526" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-12.png" alt="It Always Starts With a Spark, Initiated by You!" class="wp-image-647072"/></figure>



<p><em>Why take the effort to switch to Kotlin? Why not just stick with Java and move on?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The answer depends on numerous factors. While the data clearly shows Kotlin&#8217;s advantages across multiple domains, the decision isn&#8217;t purely technical. Subjectivity (“I like my language because I like it”) and skepticism towards something new, which is generally a good thing, play an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the evolution of programming languages shows that our preferences and needs change over time. Crucially, each new generation of languages incorporates fresh paradigms – (null)-safety, concise and light-weight syntax, functions as first class citizens, rich standard library, async concurrency, multiplatform support, generative-AI friendly, etc. – that give developers and organizations a decisive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without this natural progression, we’d still be coding everything in COBOL or another archaic language, unable to meet today’s demands. Evolution is therefore not optional; it’s built into the history of our industry.</p>



<p>For this evolution to take root inside a company, though, it takes more than technical merit. It requires enablers – people willing to explore, advocate, and show the value of these new paradigms in practice. In my experience, three types of engineers typically become these catalysts for Kotlin adoption:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>The pragmatic, productivity-focused Java Engineer</strong>: Experienced developers who see Java as a tool, not a religion. They&#8217;re always looking for better ways to get the job done faster.</li>



<li><strong>The quality-minded, modern language enthusiast</strong>: Engineers who prioritize readable, concise, and maintainable code. These are often the same people who would have moved to Scala in the past.</li>



<li><strong>Junior Developers</strong>: Juniors who ask the simple but powerful question: &#8220;Why should I use Java if I can use Kotlin?&#8221; Without the baggage of years of Java experience, Kotlin is often a no-brainer for them.</li>
</ol>



<p>To which group do you belong?&nbsp;</p>



<p>These early adopters ignite the first stage. But how do you start? Read on… ;-)&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Play Around Stage: Start Small – With Tests</strong></h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard about Kotlin and want to give it a try without committing to it immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the first thing you need is a developer tool where your very first Kotlin seeds can be planted. Here are some options:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://play.kotlinlang.org/</a> is a great online playground, simply type and run Kotlin code not only on the JVM but also for various other platforms (JS, WASM, etc.).<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-647084" style="width: 650px;" width="1462" height="660" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-13.png" alt="Kotlin Playground"> </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-notebook-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotlin Notebook</a> is a powerful feature for IntelliJ IDEA that allows you to easily import dependencies, execute code, and even work with data, draw graphs, etc. Here is an example that shows how easy it is to do a REST call with Spring’s RestClient:<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-647095" style="width: 650px;" width="1600" height="1035" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-11.png" alt="Kotlin Notebook"></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>IntelliJ IDEA has first-class support for Kotlin. This is no surprise, since JetBrains is the maker of Kotlin, and a large portion of IntelliJ IDEA is written in it. So, to start using Kotlin in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/get-started-with-kotlin.html#add-kotlin-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IntelliJ IDEA</a> – even in your existing Java project – is a breeze:
<ul>
<li>For <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/maven.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maven</a>, simply configure the <code>kotlin-maven-plugin</code> and the Kotlin standard library <code>kotlin-stdlib</code>.</li>



<li>For <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-configure-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gradle</a>, you configure the kotlin plugin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>…and off you go!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="498" height="444" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-14.png" alt="" class="wp-image-647106" style="aspect-ratio:1.1216216216216217;width:320px;height:auto"/></figure>



<ul>
<li>And there’s more! JetBrains recently released the Kotlin Language Server, bringing a full-featured Kotlin development experience to other IDEs beyond IntelliJ IDEA – such as VS Code. Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, you can write Kotlin in your favorite development environment. How can you evaluate the language in a real-world context with minimal impact and maximal insights? In the test suite of an existing Java project!&nbsp;</p>



<p>This safe and realistic approach to experimenting with Kotlin offers several advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Low Risk</strong>: Tests don&#8217;t affect production code.</li>



<li><strong>Learning Opportunity</strong>: You can explore the language features in a familiar context.</li>



<li><strong>Gradual Introduction</strong>: Team members can get comfortable with Kotlin syntax without pressure.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li>Try Kotest + MockK: to immediately feel the expressiveness of Kotlin’s testing DSLs (Domain-Specific Language), like the feature-rich assertions (<code>shouldHaveSize(...)</code>, infix (<code>value shouldBe 1</code>), etc.</li>



<li>Use the concise and powerful Kotlin Collections rather than Java Streams.</li>



<li>Play with various language features like Nullable types, destructuring, immutability (<code>val</code>, <code>data classes</code>), expression constructs (<code>when</code>, <code>try-catch</code>, <code>if else</code>), and many more.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is what you get:</p>

                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(

                           Collectors.flatMapping(
                                   p -> p.getRatings()
                                    .stream()
                                    .mapToDouble(Integer::doubleValue)
                                    .boxed(),   
                              Collectors.averagingDouble(Double::doubleValue)
                           )))
           )
   );
   verify(productRepository).findAll();

}

<p>Kotlin adoption usually starts with one person exploring and a few tests proving useful. Those first moments of discovery naturally lead to something larger: evaluating Kotlin in a real project.</p>

<p>When it comes to writing short scripts or CRUDs, Python is a great choice. With its rich ecosystem and broad adoption, it can be easily used to scrape some data or to perform data analysis. However, maintaining a large codebase in Python can be very problematic.</p>



<p>Python&#8217;s dynamic typing and mutable nature, while offering flexibility for rapid development, may present additional considerations in larger codebases. Event-loop-based coroutines can be tricky and may lead to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/1lsnytm/from_python_to_kotlin_why_we_rewrote_our_scraping/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/1lsnytm/from_python_to_kotlin_why_we_rewrote_our_scraping/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> subtle issues in practice</a> . Finally, the single-threaded and dynamically typed nature of this language makes Python code significantly less efficient than most of its modern competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>JVM is one of the fastest runtime platforms, making Java nearly as efficient as C. <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python.html" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Most benchmarks show that Python code is 10 to 100 times slower than Java code</a>. One <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">big research paper</a> compared the performance of multiple languages and showed that Python code is 74x more CPU-expensive than code in C, where Java code is only 1.8x more expensive. However, due to its long-standing commitment to backward compatibility, Java can feel verbose for certain tasks. Kotlin, building on that same ecosystem and offering the same efficiency, gives you access to a powerful typesystem, with modern language features focused on performance and developer ergonomics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those are the key reasons we can hear from companies or teams that decide to switch from Python to Kotlin. The Kotlin YouTube channel recently published <a href="https://youtu.be/puBXoKkQInE?si=wt32jWKXBy9eXbFw" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puBXoKkQInE" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolt’s success story</a>, but that is only one voice among many. Kotlin is an all-around sensible choice for a range of projects, as it shares many similarities with Python. At the same time, Kotlin offers better performance, safety, and a much more powerful concurrency model. Let’s see those similarities and differences in practice.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Similarities between Python and Kotlin</h2>



<p>When teaching Kotlin to both Python and Java developers, I was often surprised to discover that many Kotlin features are more frequently reported as intuitive by Python developers than their Java counterparts. Both languages offer concise syntax. Let&#8217;s compare some very simple use cases in both languages:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val language = "Kotlin"
println("Hello from $language")
// prints "Hello from Kotlin"

val list = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
for (item in list) {
  println(item)
}
// prints 1 2 3 4 5 each in a new line

fun greet(name: String = "Guest") {
  println("Hello, $name!")
}
greet() // prints "Hello, Guest!"</pre>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">language = "Python"
print(f"Hello from {language}")
# prints "Hello from Python"

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in list:
  print(item)
# prints 1 2 3 4 5 each in a new line

def greet(name="Guest"):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet()  # prints "Hello, Guest!"</pre>



<p>At first glance, there are only minor syntactic differences. Kotlin presents features well-known to Python developers, like string interpolation, concise loops, and default parameters. However, even in this simple example, we can see some advantages that Kotlin has over Python. All properties are statistically typed, so <code>language</code> is of type <code>String</code>, and <code>list</code> is of type <code>List&lt;Int&gt;</code>. That not only allows for low-level optimizations, but it also brings enhanced safety and better IDE support. All variables in the code above are also defined as immutable, so we cannot accidentally change their values. To change them, we would need to use <code>var</code> instead of <code>val</code>. The same goes for the list I used in this snippet – it is immutable, so we cannot accidentally change its content. To create a mutable list, we would need to use <code>mutableListOf</code> and type it as<code> MutableList&lt;Int&gt;</code>. This strong distinction between mutable and immutable types is a great way to avoid accidental changes, which are often the source of bugs in Python programs.</p>



<p>There are other advantages of Kotlin over Python that are similarly apparent in the above example. Python&#8217;s default arguments are static, so changing them influences all future calls. This is a well-known source of very sneaky bugs in Python programs. Kotlin&#8217;s default arguments are evaluated at each call, so they are safer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun test(list: MutableList&lt;Int> = mutableListOf()) {
  list.add(1)
  println(list)
}
test() // prints [1]
test() // prints [1]
test() // prints [1]</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Python</h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def test(list=[]):
  list.append(1)
  print(list)

test()  # prints [1]
test()  # prints [1, 1]
test()  # prints [1, 1, 1]</pre>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about classes. Both languages support classes, inheritance, and interfaces. To compare them, let&#8217;s look at a simple data class in both languages:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data class Post(
  val id: Int,
  val content: String,
  val publicationDate: LocalDate,
  val author: String? = null
)
val post = Post(1, "Hello, Kotlin!", LocalDate.of(2024, 6, 1))
println(post) // prints Post(id=1, content=Hello, Kotlin!, publicationDate=2024-06-01, author=null)</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Python</h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@dataclass
class Post:
  id: int
  content: str
  publication_date: date
  author: Optional[str] = None
    
post = Post(1, "Hello, Python!", datetime.date(2024, 6, 1))
print(post)  # prints Post(id=1, content='Hello, Python!', publication_date=datetime.date(2024, 6, 1), author=null)</pre>



<p>Kotlin has built-in support for data classes, which automatically allows such objects to be compared by value, destructured, and copied. Python requires an additional decorator to achieve similar functionality. This class is truly immutable in Kotlin, and thanks to static typing, it requires minimal memory. Outside of that, both implementations are very similar. Kotlin has built-in support for nullability, which in Python is expressed with the <code>Optional</code> type from the <code>typing</code> package.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s define a repository interface and its implementation in both languages. In Kotlin, we can use Spring Data with coroutine support, while in Python, we can use SQLAlchemy with async support. Notice that in Kotlin, there are two kinds of properties: Those defined inside a bracket are constructor parameters, while those defined within braces are class properties. So in <code>SqlitePostRepository</code>, <code>crud</code> is expected to be passed in the constructor. The framework we use will provide an instance of <code>PostCrudRepository</code>, which is generated automatically by Spring Data.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">interface PostRepository {
  suspend fun getPost(id: Int): Post?
  suspend fun getPosts(): List&lt;Post>
  suspend fun savePost(content: String, author: String): Post
}

@Service
class SqlitePostRepository(
  private val crud: PostCrudRepository
) : PostRepository {
  override suspend fun getPost(id: Int): Post? = crud.findById(id)

  override suspend fun getPosts(): List&lt;Post> = crud.findAll().toList()

  override suspend fun savePost(content: String, author: String): Post =
      crud.save(Post(content = content, author = author))
}

@Repository
interface PostCrudRepository : CoroutineCrudRepository&lt;Post, Int>

@Entity
data class Post(
  @Id @GeneratedValue val id: Int? = null,
  val content: String,
  val publicationDate: LocalDate = LocalDate.now(),
  val author: String
)</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Python</h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class PostRepository(ABC):

      return await self.session.get(Post, post_id)

      result = await self.session.execute(select(Post))
      return result.scalars().all()

  async def save_post(self, content: str, author: str) -> Post:
      post = Post(content=content, author=author)
      self.session.add(post)
      await self.session.commit()
      await self.session.refresh(post)
      return post

class Post(Base):
  __tablename__ = "posts"
  id: Mapped[int] = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
  content: Mapped[str] = Column(String)
  publication_date: Mapped[date] = Column(Date, default=date.today)
  author: Mapped[str] = Column(String)</pre>



<p>Those implementations are very similar in many ways, and the key differences between them result from choices made by the frameworks, not the languages themselves. Python, due to its dynamic nature, encourages the use of untyped objects or dictionaries; however, such practices are generally discouraged in modern times. Both languages provide numerous tools for libraries to design effective APIs. On the JVM, these languages often depend on annotation processing, whereas in Python, decorators are more common. Kotlin leverages a mature and well-developed Spring Boot ecosystem, but it also offers lightweight alternatives such as Ktor or Micronaut. Python has Flask and FastAPI as popular lightweight frameworks, and Django as a more heavyweight framework.</p>



<p>In a backend application, we also need to implement services, which are classes that implement business logic. They often do some collection or string processing. Kotlin provides a comprehensive standard library with numerous useful functions for processing collections and strings. All those functions are named and called in a very consistent way. In Python, we can make nearly all transformations available in Kotlin, but to do so, we need to use many different kinds of constructs. In the code below, I needed to use top-level functions, methods on lists, collection comprehensions, or even classes from the <code>collections</code> package. Those constructs are not very consistent, some of them are not very convenient, and are not easily discoverable. You can also see that complicated notation for defining lambda expressions in Python harms collection processing APIs. Collection and string processing in Kotlin is much more pleasant and productive.</p>

<p>Before we finish our comparison, let’s complete our example backend application by defining a controller that exposes our service through HTTP. Until now, I have used Spring Boot, which is the most popular framework for Kotlin backend development. This is how it can be used to define a controller:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@Controller
@RequestMapping("/posts")
class PostController(
   private val service: PostService
) {
   @GetMapping("/{id}")
   suspend fun getPost(@PathVariable id: Int): ResponseEntity&lt;Post> {
       val post = service.getPost(id)
       return if (post != null) {
           ResponseEntity.ok(post)
       } else {
           ResponseEntity.notFound().build()
       }
   }

   @GetMapping
   suspend fun getPostsByAuthor(@RequestParam author: String): List&lt;Post> =
       service.getPostsByAuthor(author)

   @GetMapping("/authors/report")
   suspend fun getAuthorsReport(): String =
       service.getAuthorsReport()
}</pre>



<p>However, we noticed that many Python developers prefer a lighter and simpler framework, and their preferred choice for such functionality is Ktor. Ktor allows users to define a working application in just a couple of lines of code. This is a complete Ktor Server application that implements a simple in-memory text storage (it requires no other configuration or dependencies except Ktor itself):</p>

<p>I hope that this comparison helped you see both the key similarities and differences between Python and Kotlin. As we’ve seen, Kotlin has many features that are very intuitive for Python developers. At the same time, Kotlin offers many improvements over Python, especially in terms of safety. It has a powerful static type system that prevents many common bugs, built-in support for immutability, and a very rich and consistent standard library.</p>



<p>To summarize, I believe it’s fair to say that both languages are very similar in many ways, but Kotlin brings a number of improvements – some small, some big. In addition, Kotlin offers some unique features that are not present in Python, the biggest one probably being a concurrency model based on coroutines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">kotlinx.coroutines vs. Python asyncio</h2>



<p>The most modern approach to concurrency in Kotlin and Python is based on coroutines. In Python, the most popular library for this purpose is <code>asyncio</code>, while in Kotlin, there is the Kotlin <code>kotlinx.coroutines</code> library. Both libraries can start lightweight asynchronous tasks and await their completion. However, there are some important differences between them.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the hallmark feature of <code>kotlinx.coroutines</code>: first-class support for structured concurrency. Let&#8217;s say that you implement a service like SkyScanner, which searches for the best flight offers. Now, let&#8217;s suppose a user makes a search, which results in a request or the opening of a WebSocket connection to our service. Our service needs to query multiple airlines to return the best offers. Let&#8217;s then suppose that this user left our page soon after searching. All those requests to airlines are now useless and likely very costly, because we have a limited number of ports available to make requests. However, implementing explicit cancellation of all those requests is very hard. Structured concurrency solves that problem. With kotlinx.coroutines, every coroutine started by a coroutine is its child, and when the parent coroutine is cancelled, all its children are cancelled too. This way, our cancellation is automatic and reliable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1240" height="1174" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-647589"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Once the user leaves the screen, all processes and ports get cancelled. For the above graphic, I used the free icons <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/close-eyes_18543033" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/close-eyes_18543033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Close eyes by Iconic Panda</a> and <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/landing-page_8901502" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/landing-page_8901502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Landing page by Design Circle</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, structured concurrency goes even further. If getting a resource requires loading two other resources asynchronously, an exception in one of those two resources will cancel the other one too. This way, kotlinx.coroutines ensures that we use our resources in the most efficient way. In Python, <code>asyncio</code> introduced <code>TaskGroup</code> in version 3.11, which offers some support for structured concurrency, but it is far from what kotlinx.coroutines offer, and it requires explicit usage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">suspend fun fetchUser(): UserData = coroutineScope {
  // fetchUserDetails is cancelled if fetchPosts fails
  val userDetails = async { api.fetchUserDetails() }
  // fetchPosts is cancelled if fetchUserDetails fails
  val posts = async { api.fetchPosts() }
  UserData(userDetails.await(), posts.await())
}</pre>



<p>The second important difference is thread management. In Python, <code>asyncio</code> runs all tasks on a single thread. Notice that this is not utilizing the power of multiple CPU cores, and it is not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. Using kotlinx.coroutines, coroutines can typically run on a thread pool (by default as big as the number of CPU cores). This way, coroutines better utilize the power of modern hardware. Of course, coroutines can also run on a single thread if needed, which is quite common in client applications.</p>



<p>Another big advantage of coroutines is their testing capabilities. kotlinx.coroutines provides built-in support for testing asynchronous code over a predetermined simulated timeframe, removing the need to wait while the code is tested in real time. This way, we can test asynchronous code in a deterministic way, without any flakiness. We can also easily simulate all kinds of scenarios, like different delays from dependent services. In Python, testing asynchronous code is possible using third-party libraries, but this method is not as powerful and convenient as with coroutines.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">@Test
fun `should fetch data asynchronously`() = runTest {
  val api = mockk&lt;Api> {
      coEvery { fetchUserDetails() } coAnswers {
          delay(1000)
          UserDetails("John Doe")
      }
      coEvery { fetchPosts() } coAnswers {
          delay(1000)
          listOf(Post("Hello, world!"))
      }
  }
  val useCase = FetchUserDataUseCase(api)
  val userData = useCase.fetchUser()
  assertEquals("John Doe", userData.user.name)
  assertEquals("Hello, world!", userData.posts.single().title)
  assertEquals(1000, currentTime)
}</pre>



<p>Finally, kotlinx.coroutines offer powerful support for reactive streams through the <code>Flow</code> type. It is perfect for representing websockets or streams of events. <code>Flow</code> processing can be easily transformed using operators consistent with collection processing. It also supports backpressure, which is essential for building robust systems. Python has <code>async generators</code>, which can be used to represent streams of data, but they are not as powerful and convenient as <code>Flow</code>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kotlin</strong></h4>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun notificationStatusFlow(): Flow&lt;NotificationStatus> =
  notificationProvider.observeNotificationUpdate()
      .distinctUntilChanged()
      .scan(NotificationStatus()) { status, update ->
          status.applyNotification(update)
      }
      .combine(
          userStateProvider.userStateFlow()
      ) { status, user ->
          statusFactory.produce(status, user)
      }</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Performance comparison</h2>



<p>One of the key benefits of switching from Python to Kotlin is performance. Python applications can be fast when they use optimized native libraries, but Python itself is not the fastest language. As a statically typed language, Kotlin can be compiled to optimized bytecode that runs on the JVM platform, which is a highly optimized runtime. In consequence, Kotlin applications are typically faster than Python applications.</p>



<p>Kotlin applications also use fewer resources. One reason for this is Kotlin’s more efficient memory management (a consequence of static typing). Another reason is structured concurrency, which ensures that resources are cancelled when they are no longer needed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Interoperability</h2>



<p>Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java. This means that Kotlin applications can use everything from the rich Java ecosystem. Everything that can be used in Java can easily be used in Kotlin as well (see <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">interoperability guide</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also possible to bridge between Kotlin and Python using libraries like JPype or Py4J. Nowadays, some libraries support further interoperability, like <a href="https://github.com/guimauvedigital/zodable" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/guimauvedigital/zodable" rel="noreferrer noopener">zodable</a>, which allows generating Zod schemas from Kotlin data classes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>I love Kotlin and I love Python. I’ve used both languages extensively throughout my career. In the past, Python had many clear advantages over Kotlin, such as a richer ecosystem, more libraries, and scripting capabilities. In some domains, like artificial intelligence, I still find Python to be a better choice. However, for backend development, Kotlin is clearly the better option today. It offers similar conciseness and ease of use as Python, but it is faster, safer, and scales better. If you consider switching from Python to Kotlin for your backend development, it is a transition worth making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We recently released<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/releases/tag/0.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Koog 0.5.0</a>, introducing full <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/10/koog-a2a-building-connected-ai-agents-in-kotlin/">Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol support</a>, which makes it easier than ever to build systems of interconnected AI agents in Kotlin.</p>



<p>But A2A is just the beginning. Koog 0.5.0 brings a host of improvements that make agents more persistent, tools smarter, and strategy design more intuitive. Let’s dive into the highlights.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">💡 Non-graph API for strategies</h2>



<p>Koog 0.5.0 introduces a <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-graph API</a> for defining agent strategies. You can now create and modify agent strategies directly in Kotlin, without working with graphs. The new non-graph API keeps most of Koog’s core features, including state management and history compression, so you can prototype custom strategies faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can now streamline your development cycle. Start simple with the out-of-the-box AIAgent using the default strategy. Then, experiment with the non-graph API to quickly test and find the best configuration for your task through straightforward code. Once you’re ready, scale it into a graph workflow to take full advantage of persistence for maximum reliability, as well as nested event tracing for deeper insights to build and test strategies more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🔁 Agent persistence and checkpointing improvements</h2>



<p>Complex AI workflows often depend on <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistence</a> – the ability to save and restore state without losing context or causing unintended side effects. Since we introduced persistence in Koog 0.4.0, we’ve <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued to build on it</a> to make agent state management much more reliable and flexible.</p>



<p>The new RollbackToolRegistry enables agents to undo side effects from tool calls when checkpointing, ensuring that rollbacks don’t leave your environment in an inconsistent state.</p>



<p>You can now also toggle between full state-machine persistence and message history persistence, giving you control over how much of the agent’s internal state to preserve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">⚒️ Tool API enhancements</h2>



<p>Tools are the backbone of Koog’s agent capabilities. This release refines the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tool API</a> to make tool development and integration smoother.</p>



<p>Tool descriptors are now automatically generated for class-based tools across all platforms. With this update, defining tools on multiplatform works just as smoothly as on the JVM, removing redundant setup and keeping your Tool API definitions concise and consistent.</p>



<p>With improvements to subgraphWithTask and subgraphWithVerification, finishTools is no longer required, and neither is the SubgraphResult type. You can now specify any input type, output type (including primitive types), task, tools, and models, and everything works automatically. There’s no more boilerplate – Koog infers and generates it all for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">👋 Introducing AIAgentService</h2>



<p>Managing multiple agents is now easier with the new AIAgentService. It allows you to run and manage multiple AI agents as single-use, state-managed services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">⚖️ New components and smarter interactions</h2>



<p>Koog 0.5.0 also introduces new components that enhance reasoning and control in agent systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLM as a judge</a> is a new component that uses large language models to evaluate outputs or guide decision-making processes.</p>



<p>In version 0.5.0, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/829" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a> for iterative tool calling with structured outputs. This makes it much easier to obtain typed results from any agent without having to write custom code.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/pull/747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streaming now supports tool calls</a>, allowing the use of tools while receiving results from an LLM on the fly. With this update, front-end integrated agents can now stream partial outputs to the user interface while still invoking tools as needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Koog 0.5.0 isn’t just about connecting agents – it’s about empowering them to be smarter, more persistent, and easier to design. Whether you’re experimenting with lightweight strategies, managing long-lived agent sessions, or creating sophisticated toolchains, this release brings significant improvements across the board.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">✨ Try Koog 0.5.0</h2>



<p>If you’re building agents that need to be more connected, persistent, and easier to design, Koog 0.5.0 is the right choice. Explore the <a href="https://docs.koog.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a>, build systems of multiple AI agents, and experiment faster while still benefiting from Koog’s advanced features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🤝 Your contributions make a difference</h2>



<p>We’d like to take this opportunity to extend a huge thank-you to the entire community! Your feedback, issue reports, and pull requests have been invaluable for the development of Koog!</p>

<p>Thinking about sharing your Kotlin expertise on the big stage? <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://kotlinconf.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">KotlinConf</a> is the premier event for all things Kotlin, and getting a talk accepted for inclusion in the conference is a fantastic way to contribute to the community and elevate your profile. However, submitting a talk proposal, especially for the first time, can feel daunting. With so many brilliant minds around, how do you give your proposal the best shot at being accepted?</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll share some ways to make your submission stand out, combining best practices for conference proposals with insider advice from JetBrains speakers, KotlinConf program committee members, and experienced presenters.</p>



<p>The tips are tailored to KotlinConf in particular, but most of these ideas are applicable to any developer conference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make sure your title is clear and compelling</h2>



<p>You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and your talk’s title is your earliest opportunity to capture attention. Reviewers and attendees alike may decide whether to read further based solely on those first few words.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Pamela Hill. Developer Advocate, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/pamelaahill" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pamelaahill.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelaahill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A carefully-selected title can make all the difference! Audience members often lack the time or attention span to read more than the title when deciding whether to attend a talk. Prefer clarity over a catchy or fun title that doesn’t give a good idea of what the talk is about in a nutshell.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>Choose a title that communicates your topic in plain terms, hints at the level, and makes the benefit to the audience obvious.</p>



<div style="background-color: #f1f6fe; margin-bottom: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 0%; text-align: left; min-height: px;">
<p><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTfHRUSDnS0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Your Voice Belongs Here: Creating Compelling KotlinConf Proposals</em></a></i> is a supportive and practical livestream for people from underrepresented groups in tech – whether you&#8217;re preparing for your first talk or have speaking experience and want to take the next step onto a bigger stage like KotlinConf. Join Pamela Hill and Cheuk Ting Ho, seasoned speakers, CFP writers, and friendly program committee members, as they share what makes a proposal stand out, how to shape your Kotlin journey into a strong submission, and what reviewers are really looking for.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Tell a story with your abstract – with the audience in mind</h2>



<p>Crafting a great talk is not just about presenting information – it’s also about storytelling. Think of your proposal as a promise to provide a valuable learning experience wrapped in a story that makes it engaging.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking at KotlinConf is a great experience and a huge achievement for any Kotlin developer. While choosing a great title, having highly polished animations, and curating high-quality memes might enhance your talk, the most important thing is having a story worth telling. Do you have something novel and technically interesting to present? Can you break down a topic in a way that is engaging and truly fun? Can you inspire fellow developers?</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>Your abstract should explain what you’ll cover, what the attendees will gain, and why your talk matters. Reviewers don’t need a full script, but they do need a clear, detailed impression of your talk.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we don’t need a full script for your talk as the abstract, we’re also unlikely to accept a talk where the abstract is just a single sentence. Two or three paragraphs are usually enough to provide meaningful detail.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>Think of your abstract as a preview, not a transcript – just enough detail to show the value and flow of your talk.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Start with the problem and build anticipation</h2>



<p>When writing your proposal, set the stage by outlining the challenge or pain point your talk addresses. Create curiosity before giving the solution. This builds anticipation and helps the audience connect with your topic.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/T0288D531-U03B9EX5MNY-68f44def26a8-512.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Jodie Burchell. Developer Advocate and Data Scientist</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodieburchell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@t_redactyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/t-redactyl.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hook your audience by telling them the problem you&#8217;re going to be solving. People love mystery books for a reason, and that&#8217;s because they build up a bit of suspense before they jump into the solution. A great proposal will do the same thing.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Think like an attendee: What&#8217;s their takeaway?</h2>



<p>The best proposals start with the audience. Instead of asking, <em>“</em>What do I want to present?<em>”</em>, consider what the attendees will learn and why they will find it valuable.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1FqLye0HTHxz.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Svetlana Isakova. Team Lead in Kotlin Developer Advocacy, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker </h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/sveta_isakova" target="_blank">X</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When submitting a talk, think like an attendee: Would you want to sit through this? What’s in it for the audience? That’s why we ask about key takeaways. What do you want people to learn, try, do, or feel inspired by?</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>Be precise with key takeaways. Avoid vague statements like “You’ll learn best practices.” Instead, be concrete and specific.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples from KotlinConf 2025 talks:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Learn how native dependencies interact, how they are loaded, and the unexpected complexities of the native world.” (<a href="https://youtu.be/n0LpCCv3VEY?si=UJ1zXMJx7FwSniWL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dependencies and Kotlin/Native</em></a> | Tadeas Kriz).</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>“You&#8217;ll learn how to effectively use built-in tools, recognize problematic patterns, and implement proven optimization strategies.” (<a href="https://youtu.be/QTX5_JV4TVU?si=7kpUPi3wopjC7HLV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Taming Asynchronous Beasts: Debugging and Performance Tuning in a Coroutine World</em></a> | Marcin Moskała).</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>“We&#8217;ll learn how KMP provides a unified framework for code sharing and execution across various platforms to solve the challenge of different codebases targeting different runtimes.” (<a href="https://youtu.be/OuX5325yq_I?si=LpT4Cs3aF7mwRMy9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kotlin Multiplatform&#8217;s Cross-Platform Brilliance at Norway&#8217;s 377-Year-Old National Postal Service</em></a> | Anshika Koul)</li>
</ul>



<p>Specific takeaways not only strengthen your proposal for reviewers but also make your talk more attractive to attendees when the schedule is published.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Make it Kotlin-centric</h2>



<p>KotlinConf focuses on Kotlin itself and its ecosystem. Reviewers look for proposals that highlight Kotlin’s features, multiplatform capabilities, or language design, or relevant tools from the ecosystem.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/T0288D531-U05RAPGGJAK-8766042aed05-512.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Márton Braun. Developer Advocate, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/zsmb13" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zsmb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsmb13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that your talk should be related to Kotlin! For example, not every Android talk is necessarily a good fit for the KotlinConf audience. Or talks about Jetpack Compose often cover things that work the exact same way with Compose Multiplatform, and the latter is much more likely to be accepted at KotlinConf!</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>If your talk covers a popular theme, put your own unique spin on it. A case study, a personal experience, or a surprising insight can make your submission stand out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Showcase your speaking skills</h2>



<p>Even the most brilliant idea can fall short without effective delivery. The KotlinConf program committee wants to see that you can engage the audience.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1FqLye0HTHxz.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Svetlana Isakova. Team Lead in Kotlin Developer Advocacy, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker </h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/sveta_isakova" target="_blank">X</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of your talks help us make better choices. If you’re a first-time speaker and don’t have recordings, no worries! You can simply record yourself (even just part of your proposed talk) on your laptop and share the link. We would really appreciate it.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>The KotlinConf Call for Speakers form includes a <em>Recordings of previous talks</em> field, which is a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate your presentation style and energy. If you&#8217;re new to speaking, a short, self-recorded video can make a huge difference.</p>



<p>If you don’t have formal recordings, consider including links to blog posts, open-source projects, or short demo videos related to your topic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Polishing matters: Make your proposal shine</h2>



<p>A strong proposal isn’t just about content; presentation matters too. Typos, inconsistent formatting, or vague writing can work against you.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/T0288D531-U05RAPGGJAK-8766042aed05-512.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Márton Braun. Developer Advocate, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/zsmb13" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zsmb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsmb13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your submission should show that you’ve put some thought and energy into preparing it. Check your submission for formatting issues and typos, and please don’t submit abstracts that were generated by LLMs.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>Reviewers want to see that you’ve taken care in preparing your proposal. A polished submission suggests you’ll bring the same care to your talk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Consider different formats and feel free to submit more than one talk</h2>



<p>If your topic doesn’t quite fit a full-length slot, consider proposing a lightning talk instead.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/T0288D531-U05RAPGGJAK-8766042aed05-512.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Márton Braun. Developer Advocate, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/zsmb13" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zsmb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsmb13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget that we also accept lightning talks! If you feel like your content would have to be padded to fill a regular session, it might be more enjoyable as a lightning talk.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<p>And here’s another strategic tip: Submitting multiple proposals increases your chances of being selected.</p>


    <div class="about-author ">
        <div class="about-author__box">
            <div class="row">
                                                            <div class="about-author__box-img">
                            <img decoding="async" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                                        <div class="about-author__box-text">
                                                    <h4>Pamela Hill. Developer Advocate, KotlinConf Program Committee member, KotlinConf speaker</h4>
                                                <p><a href="https://x.com/pamelaahill" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pamelaahill.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelaahill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit more than one talk! It gives you more chances to join in on the KotlinConf fun.</span></i></p>
                    </div>
                            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Don’t be afraid to get creative</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s always room for talks that are purely fun or explore unexpected aspects of Kotlin. If you have an amazing side project or discovered something truly surprising about the language, don&#8217;t hesitate to submit it!</p>



<p>The KotlinConf&#8217;26 Call for Speakers is opem! Share your Kotlin expertise with the world – server-side, web, desktop, mobile, AI/ML, and more! Submit your proposal and get a chance to speak at the year&#8217;s biggest Kotlin event!</p>



<p align="center"><a class="ek-link jb-download-button" title="Submit your session" href="https://jb.gg/l1dymy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submit your session</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Getting a talk accepted to a prestigious conference like KotlinConf is a significant achievement. It’s an opportunity to share your insights, experiences, or even fun discoveries with the Kotlin community. However, the competition is stiff, and each year, many good proposals don’t make the cut.</p>



<p>Don’t get discouraged if your submission isn’t accepted. Keep refining your ideas, practice your presentation skills, and continue to engage with the Kotlin community. Every submission is a learning experience and valuable practice. With preparation and care, the next KotlinConf stage could be yours.</p>



<p>Good luck preparing your submission for KotlinConf&#8217;26!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/compose-hot-reload.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>To do so, make sure your module has a JVM (desktop) target. Then, in IntelliJ IDEA, use the<em> Run with Compose Hot Reload</em> button wherever it is possible to run your application:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="922" height="324" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/run-with-compose-hot-reload.png" alt="Dialog with multiple &quot;run&quot; options, with &quot;Run with Compose Hot Reload&quot; highlighted" class="wp-image-644606" style="aspect-ratio:2.845679012345679;object-fit:contain;width:500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Read more <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/amper/blob/HEAD/docs/Documentation.md#compose-hot-reload-experimental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the documentation</a>.</p>


                    <div class="alert ">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> In 0.8.0, Amper required some special configuration to enable Compose Hot Reload. With the latest 0.8.1 patch release, this setting was removed and Compose Hot Reload is enabled by default in all compatible modules.</p>
        </div>
    






<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Custom Kotlin compiler version support</h2>



<p>If you’re eager to try new Kotlin compiler versions before the next Amper release, you can now customize the Kotlin compiler version with a simple setting:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">settings:
  kotlin:
    version: 2.2.20-rc</pre>



<p><em>Note: only versions 2.0.0 and above are supported</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Simplified single-platform experience</h2>



<p>If you are not using multi-platform modules, choosing between the <code>src</code> and <code>src@jvm</code> directories might be confusing.</p>



<p>In Amper 0.8.0, <code>jvm/app</code> and <code>android/app</code> modules have been simplified to only support <code>src</code>, and the <code>@jvm</code> qualifier is no longer permitted in their <code>module.yaml</code> files. We also introduced the new, dedicated product type <code>jvm/lib</code> for JVM-only libraries, which offers the same benefits and better conveys your intent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">JavaScript and Wasm targets support</h2>



<p>Amper now supports the <code>js</code>, <code>wasmJs</code>, and <code>wasmWasi</code> target platforms. You can use them in your multiplatform library modules or via one of our new application product types: <code>js/app</code>, <code>wasmJs/app</code>, and <code>wasmWasi/app</code>.</p>



<p>These application product types are very basic for now. Amper simply produces an executable JavaScript or Wasm file, but it cannot run it with <code>./amper run</code> because it doesn’t currently install any JavaScript runtime or browser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are eager to hear what you need in terms of tooling support for these product types – please let us know in the <a href="https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/amper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maven-local dependency resolution</h2>



<p>Previously, Amper only used the Maven local repository to optimize the downloads of artifacts, but never trusted its data. We always verified the artifact’s checksums against the remote repositories to ensure their integrity. This effectively prevented using this repository for artifacts that were locally built and never published to a remote repository.</p>



<p>Now, you can ask Amper to consider the Maven local repository as a regular repository to resolve from so you can depend on your local artifacts. To add this repository, use the special <code>mavenLocal</code> URL like this:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">repositories:
  - url: mavenLocal
    resolve: true</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">IDE improvements</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adding dependencies from unresolved code</h3>



<p>When your code references a symbol from a library that your existing sources don’t currently depend on, you can now use a quick-fix to add the relevant dependency.</p>



<p>You might recall from our <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/amper/2025/05/amper-update-may-2025/#adding-dependencies-for-unresolved-references">previous blog post</a> that we added this quick-fix in 0.7.0, but back then it only allowed users to add dependencies on local modules. Now, this feature also works for third-party maven dependencies that are already used in another module of your project:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-dependency-qf-coroutines.mov"></video></figure>



<p>For some specific symbols, it even works if the corresponding library isn&#8217;t in your project at all (we&#8217;ll support more in the future!):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-dependency-qf-spring.mov"></video></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Add Spring starter dependencies from inlay hints</h3>



<p>After enabling Spring Boot with <code>springBoot: enabled</code>, the <code>dependencies</code> section of the module file now offers a link to add the Spring Boot starters you may need:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/spring-starters-hint.mp4"></video></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Updated <em>New Directory</em> popup</h3>



<p>When creating new directories in a new Amper module, you can now choose from several predefined options depending on your platforms:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="520" height="467" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/new-directory-popup.png" alt="" class="wp-image-644617" style="aspect-ratio:1.113490364025696;object-fit:cover;width:340px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CLI improvements</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dependency insights</h3>



<p>A new CLI command, <code>./amper show dependencies</code>, allows you to view the dependency graph of a module:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/show-dependencies-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Custom working directory in ./amper run</h3>



<p>When using <code>./amper run</code>, Amper now respects your current working directory by default, even if you specify <code>--root my/project/is/elsewhere</code>.</p>



<p>You can also choose to run your applications in any working directory with the new CLI option <code>--working-dir</code>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Removal of Gradle-based Amper</h3>



<p>Amper used to be available as a Gradle plugin, where it acted as a façade that allowed configuring the project with Amper files while still running the build with Gradle.</p>



<p>As was <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/amper/2025/05/amper-update-may-2025/#the-future-of-standalone-amper-and-gradle-based-amper">announced previously</a>, we are phasing out Gradle-based Amper. The last release of Amper as a Gradle plugin was 0.7.0, and there will be no further releases of this plugin in this form.</p>



<p>We are aware that Gradle-based Amper allows users to integrate with plugins or to configure their builds in ways that are not yet possible in the standalone version of Amper. This is why one of our highest priorities is to provide a prototype of Amper extensibility to enable more use cases. We’re also striving to cover the most important use cases directly out of the box. If something you need is not supported yet, feel free to share your suggestions in the <a href="https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/amper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel</a> or open a <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTrack issue</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Updated default versions</h2>



<p>We updated our default versions for toolchains and frameworks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kotlin 2.2.10</li>



<li>KSP 2.2.10-2.0.2</li>



<li><code>kotlinx.serialization</code> 1.9.0</li>



<li>Ktor 3.2.3</li>



<li>Spring Boot 3.5.5</li>



<li>Compose 1.8.2</li>



<li>Android API level 36</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try Amper 0.8.0</h2>



<p>To update an existing project, use the update command:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="bash" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">./amper update</pre>



<p>To get started with Amper, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/amper/tree/HEAD/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sample projects</a> in the repository.</p>



<p>To enjoy full support for the latest Amper features, use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 EAP</a> (or newer).</p>


    <div class="buttons">
        <div class="buttons__row">
                                                <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/amper" class="btn" target="" rel="noopener">Try Amper</a>
                                                    </div>
    </div>







<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Share your feedback</h2>



<p>Amper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the <a href="https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/amper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel</a> or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTrack issue</a>. Your input and use cases help shape the future of Amper!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Extensibility prototype</h3>



<p>We’re actively working on our prototype for Amper’s extensibility and are almost done with the first iteration. In the next release, you’ll be able to try implementing your own local plugin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Libraries publication</h3>



<p>We know that Maven publication is a critical missing feature for library authors, and we’ve heeded your requests. The publication of JVM libraries to Maven repositories has been unofficially supported for some time (and used to publish Amper itself!), but we are working on providing official support for this.</p>



<p>We will also work on streamlining Maven Central publication out of the box and plan to add support for multiplatform libraries publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’ve ever tried building a system of multiple AI agents, you’ve probably run into <em>the problem</em>. It starts simple enough: You’ve got one agent writing blog posts, another proofreading them, and maybe a third suggesting or generating images. Individually, they’re effective. But getting them to work together? That&#8217;s where things might start falling apart.</p>



<p>Each agent speaks its own &#8220;language&#8221;: One uses a different API interface, another has its own message format, and they all might come with specific authentication requirements. Making them communicate means writing custom integration code for every single connection. Instead of focusing on making your agents smarter, faster, or more useful, you&#8217;re stuck building bridges between them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What A2A does: The cross-agent communication layer</h2>



<p><strong>This is where the </strong><a href="https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol</strong></a><strong> takes over.</strong></p>



<p>With A2A, your agents can communicate directly through a standardized protocol, working as a universal translator for your AI ecosystem. Your blog-writing agent seamlessly passes content to your proofreader, which triggers your image generator, while the proofreader loops back with corrections and the image generator requests style clarifications. All orchestrated through a single, unified communication layer.</p>



<p>Instead of managing dozens of point-to-point connections, A2A provides:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play connectivity</strong>: Agents automatically discover and connect with each other.</li>



<li><strong>Standardized messaging</strong>: Unified format, clear protocol, and zero translation headaches.</li>



<li><strong>Built-in orchestration:</strong> Define workflows once, and let A2A handle the coordination.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability without complexity</strong>: Add or reuse agents without rewriting existing connections.</li>
</ul>



<p>What is the result? You spend time improving your agents&#8217; capabilities, not debugging their conversations. And the best part – you can implement your agents using any language or framework you like. For JVM users, Koog is a top choice, and as of version 0.5.0, it integrates seamlessly with the A2A ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Koog does: The internal orchestration engine</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/koog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koog</a> is a Kotlin-based framework for building AI agents targeting JVM, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and in-browser applications. It excels at:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Complex workflow management</strong>: Design graph-based strategies with support for loops, branches, fallbacks, and parallel branch execution.</li>



<li><strong>Ready-to-use components</strong>: Benefit from its built-in nodes for calling LLMs and external tools, summarizing message history, and executing entire strategies.</li>



<li><strong>Tool orchestration</strong>: Turn any function in your code into a tool your AI agent can use, whether sequentially or even in parallel</li>



<li><strong>Native MCP integration</strong>: Connect seamlessly to any MCP server using the Kotlin MCP SDK.</li>



<li><strong>Memory and storage support</strong>: Built-in support for agent memory and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) workflows with efficient context management.</li>



<li><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>: Built-in retries, checkpointing, recovery mechanisms, and state persistence to ensure reliable execution.</li>



<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Full agent event handling, logging, and support for OpenTelemetry with built-in integrations with Langfuse and W&amp;B Weave.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, Koog is great for building reliable AI agents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why pair Koog with A2A</h2>



<p>Koog and A2A cover different layers of the AI agent stack. When used together, they complement each other and fill the gaps.</p>



<p><strong>Koog already handles the hardest parts </strong>of AI orchestration needed for real-world enterprise use.</p>



<p><strong>A2A adds the missing piece: </strong>It enables your Koog agents to communicate with any other A2A-compatible agents in your ecosystem. Instead of building custom integrations for each external service, your Koog AI workflows can automatically discover and use other agents.</p>



<p><strong>The result is a perfect match</strong>: Koog’s advanced workflows become A2A tasks that any agent can request, while your Koog agents tap into the full power of the A2A ecosystem. And since Koog runs on backend, on-device, and in-browser environments, you can deliver inter-connected AI more broadly and effectively than ever before.</p>



<p>How is this possible? Let’s see!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A2A protocol</h2>



<p>The A2A protocol defines the essential building blocks for agent-to-agent communication:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Agent discovery</strong> through standardized agent cards (JSON documents that describe capabilities).</li>



<li><strong>Message formats</strong> for requests and responses with consistent schemas.</li>



<li><strong>Task lifecycle</strong> management with clear states: submitted → working → completed/failed.</li>



<li><strong>Transport layers</strong> such as JSON-RPC, gRPC, and REST.</li>



<li><strong>Security schemes</strong> using standard OAuth2, API keys, and JWT tokens.</li>



<li><strong>Error handling</strong> with standardized error codes.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1008" height="752" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-50.png" alt="" class="wp-image-645498"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent cards: Digital business cards</h3>



<p>Every agent in the A2A ecosystem publishes its capabilities through an &#8220;agent card&#8221; – a standardized JSON file hosted at some URL, e.g. <em>/.well-known/agent-card.json</em>, on the agent&#8217;s domain. The agent card acts as a digital business card, allowing other agents to discover the services it provides.</p>



<p>An agent card typically contains:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Basic information: </strong>Such as agent name, description, and version.</li>



<li><strong>Skills</strong>: What the agent can do (e.g. draft documents, proofread text, analyze data, and generate images).</li>



<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>: How to reach the agent.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Other optional information: </strong>Enabled capabilities, authentication, and more.</li>
</ul>



<p>This discovery mechanism eliminates the need for manual integration work. When an agent needs a specific skill, it simply checks the relevant agent card to understand how to interact with that service.</p>



<p>In Koog, agent cards are defined using Kotlin data classes:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val agentCard = AgentCard(
    name = "Blog Writer",
    description = "AI agent that creates high-quality blog posts and articles",
    url = "https://api.blog-writer.com/a2a/v1",
    version = "1.0.0",
    capabilities = AgentCapabilities(streaming = true),
    defaultInputModes = listOf("text/plain"),
    defaultOutputModes = listOf("text/markdown"),
    skills = listOf(
        AgentSkill(
            id = "write-post",
            name = "Blog Post Writing",
            description = "Generate engaging blog posts on any topic",
            tags = listOf("writing", "content", "blog"),
            examples = listOf("Write a post about AI trends")
        )
    )
)</pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Universal messaging: One simple pattern</h3>



<p>A2A uses a single, standardized message format for all inter-agent communication. This simplicity is powerful – instead of learning dozens of different APIs, agents only need to understand one communication pattern.</p>



<p>Every interaction follows the same flow:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Send a message</strong> with the task request and parameters.</li>



<li><strong>Receive </strong>either immediate results or a task for tracking.</li>



<li><strong>Get updates</strong> via real-time channels for longer operations.</li>
</ol>



<p>This universal approach means adding new agent capabilities doesn&#8217;t require changing communication protocols. Whether you&#8217;re asking an agent to summarize text or generate a complex report, the message structure remains consistent.</p>



<p>In Koog, creating and sending a message is straightforward using already implemented objects and protocols:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val message = Message(
    role = Role.User,
    parts = listOf(
        TextPart("Write a blog post about the future of AI agents")
    ),
    contextId = "blog-project-456"
)

val request = Request(
    data = MessageSendParams(
        message = message,
        configuration = MessageConfiguration(
            blocking = false, // Get first response
            historyLength = 5 // Include context
        )
    )
)

val response = client.sendMessage(request)</pre>



<p>The message format supports rich content through different <em>Part</em> types, including TextPart for plain text content, FilePart for file attachments and DataPart for structured JSON data.</p>



<p>This unified structure means your Koog agents can seamlessly communicate with any A2A-compatible agent, whether it&#8217;s for text processing, file analysis, or complex data transformations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Task lifecycle: Smart workflows</h3>



<p>A2A intelligently manages different types of work based on complexity and duration:</p>



<p><strong>Immediate messages</strong>: Simple operations like text formatting or quick calculations return results directly in the AI’s response. No waiting, no tracking needed.</p>



<p><strong>Long-running tasks</strong>: Complex operations like document analysis or multi-step workflows are scheduled and return a task. The requesting agent can then monitor progress and retrieve the task results once ready.</p>



<p><strong>Real-time updates</strong>: For time-consuming operations, Server-Sent Events (SSE) provide live progress updates. This keeps agents informed without requiring constant polling.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class BlogWriterExecutor : AgentExecutor {
    override suspend fun execute(
        context: RequestContext&lt;MessageSendParams>,
        eventProcessor: SessionEventProcessor
    ) {
        val task = Task(
            contextId = context.contextId,
            status = TaskStatus(
                state = TaskState.Submitted,
                message = Message(
                    role = Role.Agent,
                    parts = listOf(TextPart("Blog writing request received")),
                    contextId = context.contextId,
    			taskId = context.taskId,
                )
            )
        )

        eventProcessor.sendTaskEvent(task)
	 ...
    }
}
</pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Built-in security: Industry standards only</h3>



<p>A2A doesn&#8217;t reinvent security. Instead, it relies on proven, widely-adopted standards like OAuth2, API keys, and standard HTTPS.</p>



<p>This approach means developers don&#8217;t need to learn new authentication schemes. If you understand modern web API security, you already understand A2A security. The system inherits all the tooling, best practices, and security audits that come with these established standards.</p>

        )

        // Delegate to parent implementation with enriched context

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to integrate Koog agents with A2A</h2>



<p>The Koog framework comes with both the A2A client and server built right in. This means your Koog agents can seamlessly talk to other A2A-enabled agents while also making themselves discoverable to the outside world. Here&#8217;s a simple example demonstrating how you can implement this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to wrap Koog agents into A2A servers</h3>



<p>First, define a strategy for the agent. Koog provides convenient converters (<em>toKoogMessage</em>, <em>toA2AMessage</em>) to seamlessly transform between Koog and A2A message formats, eliminating the need for manual serialization. Specialized nodes such as <em>nodeA2ASendMessage</em> handle the message exchange process, making communication workflows straightforward to implement:</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun blogpostWritingStrategy() = strategy&lt;MessageSendParams, A2AMessage>("blogpost-writer-strategy") {
    val blogpostRequest by node&lt;MessageSendParams, A2AMessage> { input ->
        val userMessage = input.toKoogMessage().content

        llm.writeSession {
            user {
                +"Write a blogpost based on the user request"
                +xml {
                    tag("user_request") {
                        +userMessage
                    }
                }
            }

            requestLLM().toA2AMessage()
        }
    }

    val sendMessage by nodeA2ARespondMessage()

    nodeStart then blogpostRequest then sendMessage then nodeFinish
}</pre>



<p>Second, define the agent itself. Once you install the <em>A2AServer</em> feature, your agent becomes discoverable and accessible to others in the ecosystem, enabling the creation of sophisticated networks where specialized agents collaborate seamlessly.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fun createBlogpostWritingAgent(
    requestContext: RequestContext&lt;MessageSendParams>,
    eventProcessor: SessionEventProcessor
): AIAgent&lt;MessageSendParams, A2AMessage> {
     // Get existing messages for the current conversation context
     val messageHistory = requestContext.messageStorage.getAll().map { it.toKoogMessage() }

     val agentConfig = AIAgentConfig(
        prompt = prompt("blogpost") {
            system("You are a blogpost writing agent")

            messages(messageHistory)
        },
        model = GoogleModels.Gemini2_5Flash,
        maxAgentIterations = 5
    )

    return agent = AIAgent&lt;FullWeatherForecastRequest, FullWeatherForecast>(
        promptExecutor = MultiLLMPromptExecutor(
            LLMProvider.Google to GoogleLLMClient(System.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")),
        ),
        strategy = blogpostWritingStrategy(),
        agentConfig = agentConfig
    ) {
        install(A2AAgentServer) {
            this.context = requestContext
            this.eventProcessor = eventProcessor
        }

        handleEvents {
            onAgentFinished { ctx ->
                // Update current conversation context with response from the agent
                val resultMessge = ctx.result as A2AMessage
                requestContext.messageStorage.save(resultMessge)
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>



<p>Third, we need to wrap the agent into the executor and then define a server.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">class BlogpostAgentExecutor : AgentExecutor {
    override suspend fun execute(
        context: RequestContext&lt;MessageSendParams>,
        eventProcessor: SessionEventProcessor
    ) {
        createBlogpostWritingAgent(context, eventProcessor)
            .run(context.params.message)
    }
}

val a2aServer = A2AServer(
    agentExecutor = BlogpostAgentExecutor(),
    agentCard = agentCard,
)</pre>



<p>The final step is to define a server transport and run the server.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val transport = HttpJSONRPCServerTransport(
    requestHandler = a2aServer
)

transport.start(
    engineFactory = Netty,
    port = 8080,
    path = "/a2a",
    wait = true,
    agentCard = agentCard,
    agentCardPath = A2AConsts.AGENT_CARD_WELL_KNOWN_PATH
)</pre>



<p>Now your agent is ready to handle requests!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to call other A2A-enabled agents from a Koog agent</h3>



<p>First, you need to configure an A2A client and connect it to fetch an Agent Card.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val agentUrl = "https://example.com"

val cardResolver = UrlAgentCardResolver(
    baseUrl = agentUrl,
    path = A2AConsts.AGENT_CARD_WELL_KNOWN_PATH,
)

val transport = HttpJSONRPCClientTransport(
    url = agentUrl,
)

val a2aClient = A2AClient(
    transport = transport,
    agentCardResolver = cardResolver
)

// Initialize client and fetch the card
a2aClient.connect()</pre>



<p>Then you can use <em>nodeA2ASendMessage </em>or <em>nodeA2ASendMessageStreaming</em> in your strategy to call these clients and receive a message<em> </em>or task response.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="kotlin" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">val agentId = "agent_id"
val agent = AIAgent&lt;String, String>(
    promptExecutor = MultiLLMPromptExecutor(
        LLMProvider.Google to GoogleLLMClient(System.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")),
    ),
    strategy = strategy&lt;String, String>("a2a") {
        val nodePrepareRequest by node&lt;String, A2AClientRequest&lt;MessageSendParams>> { input ->
            A2AClientRequest(
                agentId = agentId,
                callContext = ClientCallContext.Default,
                params = MessageSendParams(
                    message = A2AMessage(
                        messageId = Uuid.random().toString(),
                        role = Role.User,
                        parts = listOf(
                            TextPart(input)
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        }
        val nodeA2A by nodeA2AClientSendMessage(agentId)
        
        val nodeProcessResponse by node&lt;CommunicationEvent, String> {
            // Process event
            when (it) {
                is A2AMessage -> it.parts
                    .filterIsInstance&lt;TextPart>()
                    .joinToString(separator = "\n") { it.text }
                
                is Task -> it.artifacts
                    .orEmpty()
                    .flatMap { it.parts }
                    .filterIsInstance&lt;TextPart>()
                    .joinToString(separator = "\n") { it.text }
            }
        }

        nodeStart then nodePrepareRequest then nodeA2A then nodeProcessResponse then nodeFinish

    },
    agentConfig = agentConfig
) {
   install(A2AAgentClient) {
        this.a2aClients = mapOf(agentId to client)
    }
}

agent.run("Write blog post about A2A and Koog integration")</pre>
