<p>Java’s development embraces the past as well as the future and after contributing to it for over 30 years, John Rose is intimately familiar with the process. In this episode he talks about feature design, the right amount of technical debt (which isn’t actually zero), why Rice’s theorem demands a mix of static and dynamic checks, how Project Sumatra eventually birthed Panama and Babylon, and more.</p>

<p>In this episode, Nicolai interviews John Rose, Senior Architect of the Java Virtual Machine, who brings over 30 years of experience advancing the Java platform.</p>

<p>The entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet</code> package has been removed from JDK 26, which will release in March 2026.
JDK 25 (an LTS release depending on your vendor) is the last Java SE version to include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet</code> API.
This was done under <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/504">JEP 504: Remove the Applet API</a> and the reasons behind the removal as well as its timing deserve an explanation.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-background-about-applets">A Bit of Background About Applets</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet.Applet</code> class was a foundational class of the Java platform from the very beginning, shipping with JDK 1.0 in 1996.
At the time, the majority of uses of Java revolved around applets, which were small programs that would run in a shared virtual machine, typically embedded in one of the browsers of the day (predominantly Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer via the Java Browser Plugin).
They added a level of capability impossible with early versions of HTML.</p>

<p>The lifecycle of these small applets was determined by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet.Applet</code> APIs.
Java Applets were downloaded from a web server just like HTML and if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;APPLET&gt;</code> tag was supported, the applet would run because your locally installed Java Plugin would bridge the platform-independent bytecode to your system.</p>

<p>Applets were used for enhancing the user experience on the web, in business applications, games, and other consumer applications.
The Java Security Manager sand-boxed these applets to provide assurance to end users that this downloaded untrusted code could not access anything on their local systems without their permission, nor make network connections except back to its originating host.
And to print, it had to ask the end user directly.
This was all revolutionary at the time.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-is-now-different">The World Is Now Different</h2>

<p>Because deployment models have changed and browsers stopped supporting the plugin model, applets are no longer possible on modern web browsers.
But outside of the web browser / downloaded untrusted code scenario, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet</code> API package rarely made sense for end user applications and so without that, it has long been a mostly non-functional part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.desktop</code> module.</p>

<p>The standalone JDK has never itself provided any way to run applets, even though it provided the API.
Some other code, like the Java plugin, which was never a part of the OpenJDK project, or the bundled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appletviewer</code> tool meant for developer testing, or the JDK’s regression test framework, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jtreg</code>, also a developer only tool, provided the implementation.
The final nail was that JDK 24 <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/486">permanently disabled the Java Security Manager</a>, so the sandbox for running untrusted code was no longer possible.</p>

<p>So it is time to remove the Applet API from the latest <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/14">tip</a> JDK.
Taking account of the long history and many uses of Applets over the years, this removal has not been done without lots of warnings, preparation, and consideration.</p>

<p>The preparatory work to remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet</code> has been ongoing since 2016, so it will have been a 10 year project.
It began with <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/289">deprecating</a> the Applet API in JDK 9, then <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/398">deprecating-for-removal</a> in JDK 17 in 2021.
Also, the bundled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appletviewer</code> tool was <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8074165">deprecated</a> in JDK 9 and then <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8200146">removed</a> in JDK 11 in 2018.
A lot of effort was spent on updating thousands of JDK <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jtreg</code>-based functional tests to no longer rely on the Applet API, tweaking specifications that incidentally mention applets, etc. - a huge effort.</p>

<p>So, it will have taken 10 years to get to this point of removal.
Please don’t say you briefly looked elsewhere and somehow missed all of these memos!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h2>

<p>JDK 8 updates continue to support applets for increasingly rare legacy browser situations and also support Java Web Start (JNLP) enabled applets.</p>

<p>We now encourage developers to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jpackage</code> to deploy Java applications to end-users.
This JDK-provided tool creates native platform installers, so that a Java program installs on their system like any other application.</p>

<p>We expect that only a very few standalone AWT/Swing applications use the Applet API and they should be able to migrate.
The class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet.Applet</code> is just a subclass of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.awt.Panel</code>, so it is easy to migrate unless they use a method specific to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Applet</code>.
This is likely very rare for desktop applications and in general these were never useful for such a case.</p>

<p>Some users reported that they didn’t use the Applet API for applets but used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.applet.AudioClip</code> as a convenient audio playback API in applications.
In JDK 25, we introduced <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javax.sound.SoundClip</code> as a replacement for that.</p>

<p>If you need further help migrating away from the Applet API, contact your support provider.</p>

<p>The rest of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.desktop</code> module (i.e. AWT, Swing, Java 2D) in the JDK is unaffected in functionality and continues to be supported and enhanced.</p>
