&lt;p&gt;Telecommunications networks are undergoing a cloud-native revolution. 5G promises ultra-fast connectivity and real-time services, but achieving those benefits requires an infrastructure that is agile, low-latency, and highly reliable. Kubernetes has emerged as a cornerstone for telecom operators to meet 5G demands. In 2025, Canonical Kubernetes delivers a single, production-grade Kubernetes platform with long-term support (LTS) and telco-specific optimizations, deployable across clouds, data centers, and the far edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog explores how Canonical Kubernetes empowers 5G and cloud-native telco workloads with high performance, enhanced platform awareness (EPA), and robust security, while offering flexible deployment via snaps, Juju, or Cluster API. We’ll also highlight its integration into industry initiatives like Sylva, support for GPU/DPU acceleration, and synergy with MicroCloud for scalable edge infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The rise of the cloud-native telco&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom decision-makers face immense pressure to evolve their networks rapidly and cost-effectively. Traditional, hardware-centric architectures struggle to keep pace with 5G’s requirements for low latency, high throughput, and dynamic scaling. This is where Kubernetes – the de facto platform for cloud-native applications – comes in. Kubernetes brings powerful automation, scalability, and resiliency that allow telcos to manage network functions like software across data centers, public clouds, and far-edge deployments. The result is a more agile operational model: services can be rolled out faster, resources automatically optimized to demand, and updates applied continuously without disrupting critical services. In the 5G era, such agility is essential for delivering innovations like network slicing, multi-access edge computing (MEC), and AI-driven services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Kubernetes opens the door for telcos to refactor their network functions into microservices. Instead of relying on monolithic appliances or heavy virtual machines, operators can deploy &lt;em&gt;cloud-native network functions (CNFs)&lt;/em&gt; – essentially containerized network services – that are lighter and faster to roll out than traditional virtual network functions (VNFs). By shifting to CNFs, new network features (whether a 5G core component or a firewall) can be introduced or updated in a fraction of the time, using automated CI/CD pipelines instead of lengthy manual upgrades. This approach helps telcos simplify the migration from legacy systems to a more agile, software-driven network model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, adopting Kubernetes for telecom workloads also means meeting rigorous performance and reliability standards. Carrier-grade services like voice, video, and core network functions can’t tolerate unpredictable delays or downtime. Telco leaders need a Kubernetes platform that combines cloud-native flexibility with &lt;em&gt;telco-grade&lt;/em&gt; performance, security, and support. Canonical Kubernetes answers that call, providing a Kubernetes distribution specifically tuned for telecommunications needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Canonical Kubernetes: optimized for cloud-native 5G networks and edge computing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical’s Kubernetes distribution has been engineered from the ground up to address the unique challenges of 5G and cloud-native telco cloud deployments. It is a single, unified Kubernetes offering that blends the ease of use of lightweight deployments with the robustness of an enterprise-grade platform. Importantly, Canonical Kubernetes can be deployed and managed in whatever way best fits a telco’s environment – whether installed as a secure snap package or integrated with full automation tooling like Juju (model-driven operations) or Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI). This flexibility means operators can start small at the network edge or scale up to carrier-core clusters, all using the same consistent platform. Notably, Canonical Kubernetes brings cloud-native telco-friendly capabilities in the areas of performance, networking, operations, and support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;High performance &amp;amp; low latency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/an-introduction-to-real-time-linux-part-i"&gt;Real-time linux kernel&lt;/a&gt; support ensures that high-priority network workloads execute with predictable, ultra-low latency, a critical requirement for functions like the 5G user plane function (UPF). In parallel, built-in support for advanced networking (including SR-IOV and DPDK) enables fast packet processing by giving containerized network functions direct access to hardware, dramatically reducing network I/O latency for high bandwidth 5G applications. Together, these features allow cloud-native network functions to meet stringent performance and determinism once only achievable on specialized telecom hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GPU acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Kubernetes integrates seamlessly with acceleration technologies to support emerging cloud-native telco workloads. It works with NVIDIA’s GPU and networking operators to leverage hardware accelerators (GPUs, SmartNICs, DPUs) for intensive tasks. It supports NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), which expands the performance and value of the NVIDIA’s data center GPUs, such as the latest GB200 and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition by partitioning the GPU into up to seven instances, each fully hardware isolated with its own high-bandwidth memory, cache, and streaming multiprocessors. The partitioned instances are transparent to workloads which greatly optimizes the use of resources and allows for serving workloads with guaranteed QoS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means telecom operators can run AI/ML analytics, media processing, or virtual RAN computations that take advantage of GPUs and DPU offloading within their Kubernetes clusters – all managed under the same platform. By tapping into hardware acceleration, telcos can deliver advanced services (like AI-driven network optimization or AR/VR streaming) with high performance, without needing separate siloed infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Operational efficiency and automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day-0 to Day-2 operations are streamlined through automation in Canonical’s stack. The distribution supports full lifecycle management – clusters can be deployed, scaled, and updated via one-step commands or integrated CI/CD pipelines, reducing manual effort and errors. Using Juju charms, Canonical’s model-driven operations further simplify complex orchestration, enabling teams to configure and update Kubernetes and related services in a repeatable, declarative way. Built-in self-healing and high availability features ensure that the platform can recover from failures automatically, keeping services running without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This high degree of automation translates into faster rollout of new network functions and updates (with minimal downtime), allowing telco teams to focus on innovation rather than routine ops tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Edge flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Kubernetes is designed to run from the core to the far edge with equal ease. Its lightweight, efficient design (delivered as a single snap package) results in a low resource footprint, making it viable even on a one- or two-node edge cluster in a remote site. At the same time, it scales up to multi-node deployments for central networks. The platform supports a variety of configurations – from a single node for an ultra-compact edge appliance, to a dual-node high-availability cluster, to large multi-node clusters for data centers – all with the same tooling and consistent experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility allows operators to extend cloud capabilities to edge locations (for ultra-low latency processing) while managing everything in a unified way. In practice, Canonical’s solution can power cloud-native telco IT workloads, 5G core functions, and edge applications under one umbrella, meeting the specific performance and latency needs of each environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long-Term support and stability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical backs its Kubernetes with long-term support options far exceeding the typical open-source release cycle. &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/blog/12-year-lts-for-kubernetes"&gt;Each Canonical Kubernetes LTS version can receive security patches and maintenance for up to 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring a stable foundation for cloud-native telco services over the entire 5G rollout and beyond. (For comparison, upstream Kubernetes offers roughly 1 year of support per release).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extended support window means carriers can avoid frequent, disruptive upgrades and rest assured that their infrastructure remains compliant over the long term. Such a commitment to stability is a key reason telecom operators choose Canonical – long-term maintenance provides confidence that critical network workloads will run on a hardened, well-maintained platform for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cost efficiency and vendor neutrality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open-source, upstream-aligned distribution, Canonical Kubernetes has no licensing costs and prevents vendor lock-in. Telcos are free to deploy it on their preferred hardware or cloud, and they benefit from a large ecosystem of Kubernetes-compatible tools and operators. The platform’s efficient resource usage and automation also help drive down operating costs – by improving hardware utilization and simplifying management, it enables operators to serve growing traffic loads without linear cost increases. In short, Canonical’s Kubernetes offers carrier-grade performance and features at a fraction of the cost of proprietary alternatives, all while keeping the operator in control of their technology roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Enabling a new wave of cloud-native telco services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Canonical Kubernetes, cloud-native telcos can position themselves to innovate faster and operate more efficiently in the 5G era. They can readily stand up cloud-native 5G Core functions, scale out Open RAN deployments, and push applications to the network edge – all on a consistent Kubernetes foundation. In fact, Kubernetes makes it feasible for telcos to transition from traditional VNFs on virtual machines to containerized CNFs, reducing resource overhead and speeding up deployment of network features. This means legacy network applications can be modernized step-by-step and run alongside new microservices on the same platform, avoiding risky “big bang” overhauls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is not only technical efficiency but business agility: operators can launch new services (from enhanced mobile broadband to IoT analytics) in weeks instead of months, respond quickly to customer demand spikes, and streamline the integration of new network functions or vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early adopters in the industry are already seeing the benefits. For example, &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/bringing-canonical-kubernetes-to-sylva-a-new-chapter-for-european-telco-clouds"&gt;Canonical’s Kubernetes has been embraced in initiatives like the European Sylva open telco cloud project&lt;/a&gt;, in part due to its security, flexibility and long-term support advantages. This momentum underscores that a performant, open Kubernetes platform is becoming a strategic asset for telcos aiming to stay ahead in a competitive landscape. Perhaps most importantly, Canonical Kubernetes lets telcos focus on delivering value to subscribers – ultra-reliable connectivity, rich digital services, tailored enterprise solutions – rather than getting bogged down in infrastructure complexity. It abstracts away much of the heavy lifting of deploying and upgrading distributed systems, while providing the controls needed to meet strict cloud-native telco requirements. The combination of automation, performance tuning, and openness creates a powerful engine for telecom innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cloud-native at any scale: Canonical Kubernetes meets MicroCloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the edge, complexity is the enemy. That’s why Canonical Kubernetes pairs naturally with MicroCloud, our lightweight production-grade cloud infrastructure for distributed environments. MicroCloud fits the edge use case extremely well: it is easy to deploy, fully automated, and optimized for bare-metal and low-power sites. Drop it into a telco cabinet, regional hub, or remote data center, and you get a resilient control plane for running Kubernetes, virtualization, and storage with zero overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such deployments, MicroCloud and Canonical Kubernetes form a tightly integrated stack that brings cloud-native operations to the far edge. Need to orchestrate CNFs next to VMs? Spin up a single-node cluster with high availability? Scale to dozens of locations without rearchitecting? This combo makes it possible, with snaps for simple updates, Juju for full automation, and long-term support built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion: building the future of cloud-native telco on open source Kubernetes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5G and edge computing are reshaping telecom networks, and Kubernetes has proven to be an essential technology powering this evolution.&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/industrial"&gt; Industrial IoT&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/automotive"&gt; automotive applications&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/internet-of-things/smart-city"&gt; smart cities&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/robotics"&gt; robotics&lt;/a&gt;, remote health care, and the gaming industry rely on high data transfer, close to real time latency, very high availability and reliability. Canonical Kubernetes brings the best of cloud-native innovation to the telecom domain in a form that aligns with carriers’ operational realities and performance needs. It delivers a rare mix of benefits – agility and efficiency from automation, high performance for demanding workloads, freedom from lock-in, and assured long-term support – making it a compelling choice for any telco modernizing its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecommunications leaders looking to become cloud-native telcos should consider how an open-source platform like Canonical Kubernetes can serve as a foundation for growth. Whether the goal is to reduce operating costs in the core network, roll out programmable 5G services at the edge, or simply break free from proprietary constraints, Canonical’s Kubernetes distribution provides a proven path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Ubuntu releases never slip because we run on a strict rhythm: six-month cycles, two-week pulses, and in-person sprints. Every change is deliberate, ensuring stability without losing agility. This discipline is what enables us to provide 15 years of Long-Term Support. Reliability is built into everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;In software engineering, we often talk about the “iron triangle” of constraints: time, resources, and features. You can rarely fix all three. At many companies, when scope creeps or resources get tight, the timeline is often the first element of the triangle to slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canonical, we take a different approach. For us, &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; is the fixed constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about strict project management. It is a mechanism of trust. Our users, customers, and the open source community need to know exactly when the next Ubuntu release is coming. To deliver that reliability externally, we need a rigorous operational rhythm internally, and for over 20 years, we have honored this commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how we orchestrate the business of building software, from our six-month cycles to the daily pulse of engineering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Fig. 1 Canonical’s Operating Cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The six-month cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entire engineering organization operates on a six-month cycle that aligns with the Ubuntu release cadence. This cycle is our heartbeat. It drives accountability and ensures we ship features on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this work, we rely on three critical control points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprint Readiness Review (SRR): This is where prioritization happens. Before a cycle begins, we don’t just ask “what fits?”: we ask “what matters?” We go through feedback to find the most valuable engineering opportunities, ensuring we prioritize quality and impact over volume. We don’t start the work until we know the scope is worth the effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Roadmap Sprint: The SRR culminates in this one-week, face-to-face event. This is the formal moment of truth where we close out the previous cycle and leadership signs off on the plan for the next one. It ensures that every team leaves the room with a clear, approved mandate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midcycle Review: Three months in, we hold a “Virtual Sprint” to check our progress. Crucially, we review any “bad news”, in which we immediately identify items that will not ship or are at risk. By addressing what won’t happen upfront, leadership can make informed decisions to course-correct immediately rather than letting a deadline slip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discipline ensures we stay agile, and that we can adjust our trajectory halfway through without derailing the entire delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two-week pulse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the six-month cycle sets the destination, the “pulse” gets us there. A pulse is our version of a two-week agile sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these pulses are synchronized across the entire company, on a cross-functional basis. Marketing, Sales, and Support all operate on this same frequency. When a team member says, “we will do it next pulse,” everyone, regardless of department, knows exactly what that means. This creates a shared expectation of delivery that keeps the whole organization moving in lockstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprints are for in-person connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We distinguish between a “pulse” (our virtual, two-week work iteration) and a “sprint.” For us, a sprint is a physical, one-week event where teams meet face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a remote-first company, which makes these moments invaluable. Sprints provide the high-bandwidth communication and human connection needed to sustain us through months of remote execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also stagger these sprints to separate context. Our &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Sprints&lt;/strong&gt; happen in May and November (immediately after an Ubuntu release) so teams can focus purely on technical roadmapping. &lt;strong&gt;Commercial Sprints&lt;/strong&gt; happen in January and July, aligning with our fiscal half-years to focus on business value. This “dual-clock” system ensures that commercial goals and technical realities are synchronized without overwhelming the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the exceptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, market reality doesn’t always adhere to a six-month schedule. Customers have urgent needs, and high-value opportunities appear unexpectedly. To handle this without breaking our rhythm, we use the &lt;strong&gt;Commercial Review (CR)&lt;/strong&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CR process protects our engineering teams from chaos while giving us the agility to say “yes” to the right opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; We don’t let unverified requests disrupt the roadmap. A Review Board assesses every non-standard request before we make a promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conscious trade-offs:&lt;/strong&gt; If a new request is critical, we ask: “What are we removing to make space for this?” It forces a conscious decision. We review the roadmap and agree on what gets deprioritized to satisfy the new request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that when we do deviate from the plan, it is a strategic choice, not an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality as a natural habit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underpinning this entire rhythm is a commitment to quality standards. We follow the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) cycle, a concept rooted in ISO 9001. While we align with these formal frameworks, it has become a natural habit for us at Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operational discipline is what enables up to &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/blog/canonical-expands-total-coverage-for-ubuntu-lts-releases-to-15-years-with-legacy-add-on"&gt;15 years of LTS commitment&lt;/a&gt; on a vast portfolio of open source components, providing Long-Term Support for the entire, integrated collection of application software, libraries, and toolchains. Offering 15 years of security maintenance on our entire stack is only possible because we are operationally consistent. Long-term stability is the direct result of short-term discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sticking to this rhythm, we ensure that Canonical remains not just a source of great technology, but a reliable partner for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canonical is pleased to announce an expanded collaboration with AMD to package and maintain AMD ROCm™ software directly in Ubuntu. AMD ROCm is an open software ecosystem to enable hardware-accelerated AI/ML and HPC workloads on AMD Instinct™ and AMD Radeon™ GPUs, simplifying the deployment of AI infrastructure with long term support from Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical has formed a dedicated team of engineers to package the AMD ROCm software libraries to streamline installation, support, and long-term maintenance on Ubuntu. Canonical will also submit these packages for consideration in Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work will simplify the delivery of AMD AI solutions in data centers, workstations, laptops, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and edge environments. AMD ROCm software will be available as a dependency for any Debian package, snap, or Docker image (OCI) build.  Performance fixes and security patches will automatically be available to production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaboration aims to make AMD ROCm software available in Ubuntu starting with Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, with updates available in every subsequent Ubuntu release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD ROCm software: a commitment to open source &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical works with silicon industry leaders to incorporate the software libraries and drivers that accelerate applications on their silicon directly into Ubuntu. Comprehensive support for the latest silicon dramatically accelerates developer adoption and production deployments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AMD, the software that enables hardware-accelerated AI processing is called ROCm. It is an open software platform that includes runtimes, compilers, libraries, kernel components, and drivers that together accelerate industry standard frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Jax, and more on supported AMD GPUs and APUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AMD ROCm software enables open, high-performance acceleration for AI and HPC on AMD hardware. Working with Canonical to package AMD ROCm for Ubuntu makes it easier for developers and enterprises to deploy AMD solutions on supported systems,” said Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President, GPU Technologies and Engineering Software and Chief Software Officer at AMD.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging AMD ROCm in Ubuntu underscores the strong AMD commitment to developer experience and enterprise experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler installation with ‘apt install rocm’ or as an automatic dependency for other projects, like ollama-amd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both stable LTS and fresh ROCm versions every six months will be available, to ensure immediate support for the latest hardware and software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy security fixes and performance improvements (just “apt upgrade”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 15 years of support for AMD ROCm in Ubuntu LTS versions under Ubuntu Pro. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Ubuntu Pro subscriptions are free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to work alongside AMD and the community to package AMD ROCm libraries directly into Ubuntu,” said Cindy Goldberg, SVP of Silicon and Cloud Alliances at Canonical. “This will simplify the use of AMD hardware and software for AI workloads, and enable organizations to meet security and maintenance requirements for production use at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Improved hardware support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical works closely with hardware manufactures to test, optimize, and certify Ubuntu for their devices, and to integrate the required software drivers and kernel patches to support that hardware.

&lt;p&gt;5G continues to transform the telecommunications landscape, enabling massive device density, edge computing, and new enterprise use cases. However, operators still face significant cost pressures: from accelerating RAN modernization and 5G SA rollouts to energy demands and the shift to cloud-native network functions (CNFs). As telcos redesign their infrastructure strategies, open source has become a key lever to reduce costs, increase flexibility, and accelerate innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog outlines today’s primary 5G infrastructure challenges and highlights how modern open source cloud technologies from Canonical help operators address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The telco dilemma: 5G infrastructure challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advancements of 5G and more complex deployments, telcos face several challenges in building and maintaining 5G infrastructure, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High investment costs:&lt;/strong&gt; 5G infrastructure requires significant investment in new hardware and software, especially for hosting the virtualization infrastructure necessary to run 5G software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising OPEX and energy costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Power consumption of distributed 5G sites is now one of the largest operational expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-native complexity:&lt;/strong&gt; Moving from virtualized network functions (VNFs) to cloud-native network functions (CNFs) increases the need for Kubernetes-scale automation and observability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregated RAN and multi-vendor integrations:&lt;/strong&gt; Open RAN and virtualised RAN require consistent infrastructure, automation and lifecycle management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited spectrum:&lt;/strong&gt; The available spectrum for 5G is limited and highly regulated, which can make it difficult for telcos to acquire and use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge footprint explosion:&lt;/strong&gt; 5G MEC deployments increase the number of sites operators must manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talent and skills gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud-native and Kubernetes skills remain scarce in telecom operations teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; 5G networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and privacy of users’ data. The attack surface is larger with 5G compared to previous generations of mobile networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor Lock-in:&lt;/strong&gt; a telecom operator is heavily dependent on one or a few vendors for all of its 5G network infrastructure and services, making it difficult for the operator to switch to another vendor without incurring significant costs and disruption to its network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How open source is changing the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source plays a central role in enabling telcos to modernise their networks: from VNF virtualization to full cloud-native CNF deployments. By standardizing on open platforms like Ubuntu, Kubernetes and OpenStack, operators reduce infrastructure licensing costs, improve interoperability, and accelerate innovation. Today, most large operators run the majority of their 5G core workloads on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shared standards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source communities, including CNCF, O-RAN Alliance and Project Sylva, provide common frameworks that reduce integration effort. By adopting open standards, operators can more easily mix vendors and ensure long-term ecosystem interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Avoid vendor lock-in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the development of shared standards, open source solutions can help avoid vendor lock-in by providing access to code that can be modified and adapted to meet specific needs. This means that telcos and ISVs can avoid being tied to a particular vendor or technology stack and choose the best solutions for their specific requirements instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Meet specific-telco requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos have demanding requirements when it comes to performance, reliability, and security. Long-term support (LTS) is important in the telco industry, as telcos often have long cycles of release deployment. Open source solutions that are supported over the long term, with no API breaks or major changes that could disrupt telco operations (i.e. 12-month release at least, and a few years on average) are the foremost choice for telcos. This is usually a vendor-driven decision, but choosing the right open source with the right vendor is the key here. The reason is, it is difficult to have a telco-grade system after dealing with all the interoperability and fixing into the puzzle challenges, so it is reasonable for an operator to expect the support cycle to be as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance, flexibility, and automation are key requirements in the telco industry, as they enable telcos to operate more efficiently and effectively. By leveraging the expertise of the wider community, telcos, and ISVs can build solutions that are optimised for telco environments and that can be easily customised to meet specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cost optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source software offers cost savings compared to proprietary solutions, which can be especially beneficial for organizations with limited budgets. With open source software, organizations do not need to pay for licenses, and there are no vendor lock-ins. They can leverage the vast community of developers and users to troubleshoot issues and implement new features. In addition to removing licensing fees, open source automation frameworks significantly reduce operational costs by simplifying CNF lifecycle management, improving energy optimization, and enabling consistent operations across core, edge and RAN deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telecom sector handles a vast amount of sensitive information, including personal and financial data, making it a prime target for cyber-attacks. There are several data privacy and security concerns that the telecom sector faces, including data breaches, malware attacks, insider threats, lack of compliance, etc. In this regard, open source software vulnerabilities are often patched more quickly than with proprietary software. In addition, open source software is transparent and customisable, making it easier to meet the operator’s unique needs and implement security features that align with their security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sections that follow we provide example applications for open source solutions across the telco stack, with a focus on tooling supported by Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source solutions for telcos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical’s telco portfolio spans the entire network – from RAN compute nodes to edge clouds, MEC platforms, private clouds and public-cloud deployments. Ubuntu and our cloud-native infrastructure stack (MAAS, MicroCloud, OpenStack, Kubernetes and Juju) provide a consistent operational model across all layers of the 5G architecture.. This enables telcos to meet any current or future use cases – from OpenRAN to next-generation Core (5G and beyond) and AI at the edge. &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/pro"&gt;Ubuntu Pro&lt;/a&gt; is Canonical’s comprehensive subscription for enterprise security, compliance and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" height="404" loading="lazy" src="blob:https://admin.insights.ubuntu.com/7992c784-e5d4-4e93-9690-7104aa776539" width="588"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open source solutions for telcos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source for RAN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vRAN and Open RAN deployments require high performance, low latency and hardware acceleration. Canonical works closely with &lt;a href="https://builders.intel.com/docs/networkbuilders/network-and-cloud-edge-reference-system-architecture-with-flexran-software-setup-on-a-single-server-quick-start-guide-1658491779.pdf"&gt;Intel FlexRAN&lt;/a&gt;, NVIDIA Aerial and ARM ecosystem partners to optimize Ubuntu for RAN workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major Canonical contribution for RANs edge use cases is&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/guide-to-micro-clouds"&gt; MicroCloud,&lt;/a&gt; which reproduces the APIs and primitives of the big clouds at the scale of the edge. MicroClouds are typically targeted to easily deploy and lifecycle manage distributed micro clouds – bare metal compute clusters of between 3-100 nodes. A Canonical MicroCloud stack consists of certain building blocks. The details for each component are covered in our Telco 5G infrastructure&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/telco-dilemma-reduce-5g-infra-cost"&gt; whitepaper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source for core networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most operators deploy their 5G Core on private clouds to maintain strict performance and security control. Canonical’s reference architecture – &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/maas"&gt;MAAS&lt;/a&gt; for bare metal, &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/openstack"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; for virtualised infrastructure, &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; for CNFs, and &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/juju"&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt; for automation – provides a proven, carrier-grade cloud foundation adopted by major network equipment providers (NEPs) and operators globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" height="416" loading="lazy" src="blob:https://admin.insights.ubuntu.com/6db34da1-e968-4e98-9b89-9477bd901677" width="624"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canonical stack for private clouds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source for public and hybrid clouds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is known for its reliability, security, and versatility, making it a popular choice for telecom companies that require a stable and secure operating system to run Telco applications in the public cloud. A hybrid cloud architecture combines the usage of a private cloud and one or more public cloud services with a workload orchestration engine between the platforms. Using Juju, operators can orchestrate and lifecycle-manage the same CNF or VNF stack across private OpenStack, MicroCloud edge clusters, and hyperscalers. Juju automation provides a consistent approach that natively supports all major hyper scalers APIs and is a de-facto standard tool for MicroClouds in edge use cases. Additionally, Ubuntu Pro for Public Clouds provides telcos with capabilities based on their unique requirements. Details of these requirements and features from Ubuntu are given in this blog series:&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/public-clouds-for-telco-amazon-web-services"&gt; Amazon Web services (AWS)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/public-cloud-for-telco-part-2-google-cloud-platform"&gt; Google Cloud Platform (GCP)&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/public-cloud-for-telco-part-3-microsoft-azure"&gt; Microsoft Azure.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5G infrastructure modernization continues to introduce new operational and cost challenges. Open source cloud technologies, combined with Canonical’s automation and long-term support, help operators simplify their architectures, reduce OPEX, and accelerate the shift to cloud-native 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year at CES, we try to go beyond showing technology; we want to give you an experience. This time, it’s the story of how in-vehicle infotainment development is transforming, and how developers can now build, test, and deploy immersive experiences faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we’re excited to show a demo that combines the strengths of both Anbox Cloud and Rightware’s Kanzi, the industry-leading software for creating rich, visually stunning infotainment interfaces. It demonstrates cloud-native development, automation, and how virtualization can open up completely new ways to design and test next-generation in-vehicle experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1280/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_460/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_620/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1036/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 1036w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1681/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 1681w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1920/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 1920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1280/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fa0b2%2Fimage.png 1280w" width="1280"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bridging design, development, and validation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automotive software development has become incredibly complex. Teams are often focused on their own discipline, UI designers on immersive experiences, Android developers on building integrations, and validation engineers on reliability across hardware variants. These teams can’t always collaborate seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing an infotainment system means being able to access specific hardware or prototypes, which makes iteration slow and collaboration difficult. Small design updates can take days to validate, and testing across different screen configurations or performance conditions is often limited by the availability of physical setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to change that by bringing agility and scalability to infotainment development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Infotainment comes to life in the cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our demo, we’ll show how Anbox Cloud turns this traditionally hardware-bound process into a fully virtualized, cloud-native experience. By running Android in the cloud, developers can instantly deploy and test infotainment environments built using Kanzi, on demand, at any scale, from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="900" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_460/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_620/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1036/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 1036w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1681/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 1681w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1920/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 1920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ff2cd%2Fimage-1.jpeg 1600w" width="1600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Widescreen 8K infotainment CES demo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our setup fits perfectly with Rightware’s widescreen 8K infotainment and cluster bench, powered by Kanzi. Developers can stream the exact same 8K rendering using Anbox Cloud. The result is an impressive, interactive experience, generated and streamed entirely from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="302" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_460/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_620/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1036/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 1036w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1681/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 1681w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1920/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 1920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9fea%2Fimage-1.png 1600w" width="1600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8K virtual Android device running on Anbox Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Anbox Cloud, Android can be virtualized to any resolution, with pixel-perfect rendering and responsiveness. It can scale to dozens of Android instances running simultaneously, so teams can run automated testing, validate UI performance, and work on the system updates in parallel. Your development becomes faster, collaborative, and independent of physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why choose cloud-native Android development?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When moving your development testing to the cloud, designers and developers can collaborate in real time and can see their changes without waiting for hardware to be available. Validation teams can run automated tests on multiple Android instances, across different configurations. For OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, this means shorter development cycles, meaning more efficient resource use, and faster results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kanzi has always been about empowering designers and developers to bring exceptional in-vehicle experiences to life,” says Tero Koivu, Co-CEO at Rightware. “Seeing a Kanzi made UI streamed at 8K through Anbox Cloud shows how cloud-native workflows can dramatically accelerate iteration and collaboration. It opens a powerful new path for teams building the next generation of connected, visually stunning automotive user interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;See it at CES 2026&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at LVCC, North Hall, Booth #10562, and check out the workflow for yourself. You’ll see how Kanzi and Anbox Cloud come together to deliver high-fidelity, scalable, cloud-native infotainment experiences, and how this is redefining the way developers can use Android in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ubuntu Pro for WSL provides turnkey security maintenance and enterprise support for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS WSL instances in Windows. The subscription will also enable comprehensive management for system administrators. &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Canonical announced the general availability of Ubuntu Pro for WSL which can be installed from the Microsoft Store. Source and beta releases are also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-pro-for-wsl/releases"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="p-pull-quote--small"&gt;
&lt;p class="p-pull-quote__quote"&gt;Canonical and Microsoft have a fantastic partnership, building out the WSL experience. This work will benefit enterprise developers who use WSL to build production Linux solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="p-pull-quote__citation"&gt;Craig Loewen, Product Manager for WSL at Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Pro delivers enterprise-grade security maintenance and support across desktops, servers, and IoT devices. Now, that same proven value proposition comes to WSL, addressing the security and compliance needs of IT managers and paving the way for broader enterprise adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="540" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VKdAcrdjQKI?si=lzmcSzSo8xohAa3R" title="YouTube video player" width="960"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Power to developers, peace of mind for IT teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSL provides developers, system administrators, and power users with a native Linux experience on Windows, without the overhead of a full virtual machine or dual boot. It allows users to run Linux command-line tools, utilities, and graphical Linux applications directly on Windows. In collaboration with NVIDIA, WSL 2 delivers near-native GPU-accelerated-performance, allowing applications in Ubuntu to access GPU drivers directly on the Windows host. With Ubuntu Pro, this developer-focused tool is transformed into a fully supported, enterprise-ready solution with up to 15 years of security maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many enterprises, strict security and compliance policies have been a barrier to adopting WSL given the risks of unmonitored and unsupported open source software. Ubuntu Pro for WSL ensures Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) is enabled, providing CVE security updates that can be applied subject to administrative policy.

&lt;p&gt;Open source software is known for its ability to lower IT costs. But in 2025, affordability is only part of the story. A new Linux Foundation report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;mark class="has-inline-color has-black-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/world-of-open-source-global-2025"&gt;The strategic evolution of open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reveals that open source has evolved from a tactical cost-saving measure to a mission-critical infrastructure supporting enterprise-grade investments, and delivering stronger business outcomes as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transformation is supported by academic research estimating that, without open source, companies would pay roughly 3.5 times more  to build the software running their businesses – an $8.8 trillion increase.[1] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source: from “free alternative” to core infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2025 World of Open Source Survey by the Linux Foundation reveals that open source is deeply embedded across enterprise technology stacks, making it a foundation for global IT operations.  In fact, over 55% of analyzed tech stacks used a Linux-based operating system; and similarly, around half of all analyzed cloud, container, and DevOps technologies have Linux at their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey illuminates the many great reasons businesses are choosing open source: improved productivity, reduced vendor lock-in, and, unsurprisingly, lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Nearly half of organizations (46%) report an increase in business value from open source compared to last year, with 83% considering it valuable for their future. According to the World of Open Source Survey, 58% of organizations reported lower software ownership costs, and 63% cited higher productivity as a direct benefit of adopting open source. In addition, 62% reported reduced vendor lock-in and 75% judged their software quality to be higher thanks to OSS. Overall, 56% said the benefits of OSS exceeded the costs.[3] A Gartner study echoes these findings, showing that cost control and application development flexibility remain the top drivers of open source adoption.[2] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just about the costs: organizations that invest strategically in open source are 20% more likely to perceive competitive advantage, while 78% report workplace satisfaction and better talent attraction. Nearly 80% say open source makes their organization a better workplace, and 74% say it improves their ability to attract technical talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One respondent put it this way: “Open source is not supplementary tooling but an ecosystem of core infrastructure dependencies.” This captures the shift perfectly: cost savings may start the conversation, but reliability, flexibility, and long-term value now drive adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why open source reduces IT costs and keeps cutting them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same characteristics that make open source adaptable also make it economical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No per-seat licensing: organizations avoid scaling costs tied to user counts or cores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modular adoption: businesses can deploy only what they need, minimizing waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared innovation: security fixes, feature improvements, and bug patches benefit from collective community investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interoperability and exit freedom: avoiding proprietary lock-in reduces switching costs and enables infrastructure that fits business strategy rather than the vendor’s roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems based on open source tend to have lower maintenance overhead and longer life cycles, advantages that compound fast. That’s why enterprises see real savings,not just from shifting license costs to labor, but through genuine efficiency gains across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a real-world case study of that in action: Greek telecom leader Nova leveraged Canonical’s planning and open pricing to control its CAPEX and OPEX, benefiting from predictable costs and freedom from management software licensing fees. Support from Canonical paid for “real expertise that enriches our team, rather than paying for access.”[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is also the backbone of AI, making it easier to adopt this increasingly must-have technology into business operations. McKinsey research highlights how open source frameworks accelerate AI adoption, enable faster product development, and catalyze ecosystem innovation, amplifying the total value beyond mere cost savings.[4] In fact, the LF’s survey found that AI is the technology that benefits the most from being open source, according to 38% of respondents, and research from the Microsoft AI cloud Partners team showed that Linux environments such as Ubuntu deploy 63% faster with up to 306% ROl over three years.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mission-critical workloads demand enterprise-ready support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is clear: open source software lowers IT costs, but cost benefits only reach their full potential when paired with enterprise-ready support. For technical audiences, this isn’t about “just” having a backstop: it’s about operational excellence, security, and resilience. When issues do arise, they must be addressed quickly and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey shows 71% of organizations expect response times under 12 hours for critical OSS production issues, marking a shift from traditional community support to commercial-grade service-level agreements. In financial services and manufacturing, over 90% consider paid OSS support essential. This need for enterprise-grade support peaks in mission-critical workloads (54%), systems handling sensitive data (43%), and regulated sectors (38%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a perception that support is ‘too expensive’, but quite to the contrary, paid commercial support does not diminish open source’s cost benefits; instead, it enhances them. Just like OSS adoption saves on costs and licences, robust support services protect organizations against the potentially disastrous costs of downtime, compliance failures, or data breaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical’s own experience confirms that long-term OSS support is an increasingly strategic investment, especially in markets with high regulatory demands and cloud migration complexities.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, The European Space Agency (ESA), which depends on Canonical’s distributions of Kubeflow and Spark running on Kubernetes for its mission operations. ESA highlights that Canonical’s support lets them “sleep soundly,” focusing on space missions while trusting infrastructure experts for uptime and reliability.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Ubuntu Pro locks in the value of open source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest IT cost benefits of open source software come when free software innovation is combined with investments in professional support. After all, these low-cost (or sometimes free) tools are highly accessible and often intuitive to build with, but they can take a lot of time, effort, and specialized skills to maintain and secure in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical takes away that time-consuming effort from developers, and allows them to focus on building, through Ubuntu Pro + Support, our comprehensive security maintenance and support service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ubuntu Pro + Support gives users a wide range of benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 15 years of security maintenance and support covering thousands of open source components from the kernel to the applications layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compliance-ready patching for mission-critical, regulated, and sensitive workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictable enterprise SLAs aligned with the sub–12-hour incident response expectations of 71% of organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent, forecastable total cost of ownership, eliminating license uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Pro extends cost benefits beyond licensing into comprehensive lifecycle management, turning open source affordability into sustained business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open source is an economic strategy, not a shortcut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the business benefits of open source are clear to see, and widely reflected in the business landscape, where record numbers of organizations and tech stacks have open source as a core part of their mission-critical systems. The permissive licences, lack of vendor lock-in, and flexibility of open source make it a clear cost optimizer; but the most significant IT cost savings emerge when organizations combine free software innovation with enterprise-grade support, governance, and active engagement. Those who treat open source as core infrastructure aren’t just saving money: they’re building competitive, secure, and innovative foundations for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$8.8 trillion – that’s what open source is worth to the global economy. If you’re not building on it, you’re paying for it somewhere else. The organizations leading in innovation, efficiency, and resilience already know: open source is the foundation of competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could work on real-world projects, shape cutting-edge technology, collaborate with developers across the world, make a meaningful impact with your design skills, and grow your portfolio… all without applying for an internship or waiting for graduation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what we aim to do with open design: an opportunity for universities and students of any design discipline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is open design, and why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go further, let’s talk about what open design is. Many open source tools are built by developers, for developers, without design in mind. When open source software powers &lt;a href="https://static.carahsoft.com/concrete/files/1617/1597/8665/2024_Open_Source_Security_and_Risk_Analysis_Report_WRAPPED.pdf"&gt;90% of the digital world&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), it leaves everyday users feeling overwhelmed or left out. Open design wants to bridge that gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to introduce human-centred thinking into open source development, enhancing these tools to be more intuitive, inclusive, and user-friendly. Most open source projects focus on code contributions, neglecting design contributions. That leaves a vast number of projects without a design system, accessibility audits, or onboarding documentation. That’s where designers come in, helping shape better user experiences and more welcoming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open design is about more than just aesthetics. Open design helps to make technology work for people; that’s exactly what open source needs. Learn more about open design on our &lt;a href="https://canonical.design/open-design"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to raise awareness for the projects,  the problems that currently exist, and how we can fix them together,  and encourage universities and students to become advocates of open design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want universities to connect their students to real-world, meaningful design opportunities in a field that is currently lacking the creativity of designers. Our goal is to help and motivate students to bring their design skills into open source projects and become advocates, to make open design accessible, practical, and empowering! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Canonical helps universities access open design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to help universities help students to access:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-world experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Students apply their design skills to global projects to create valuable, demonstrable outcomes, beyond hypothetical briefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interdisciplinary growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Empower students to gain collaborative experience with developers, and navigate real tech workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt; No interviews, no barriers; just impact, experience, and learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have provided universities with talks and project briefs, enabling them to prepare students to utilise their expertise and design a brighter future for open source. If you’re a department leader, instructor, or coordinator, &lt;a href="https://canonical.design/open-design/get-started-for-designers"&gt;exploring open source and open design&lt;/a&gt; will help you to give your students unique access to industry-aligned experiences, while embedding values of collaboration, open contribution, and inclusive design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why should students care?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a student in UX, UI, interaction, service, visual, HCI design, or &lt;strong&gt;any other field with design influence&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ve been told how important it is to build your portfolio, gain hands-on experience, and collaborate with cross-functional teams. Open design is your opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is, you don’t have to write a single line of code to make a difference! Open source projects are looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX/UI improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility and heuristic audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research and persona development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User flows and wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information architecture reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design documentation and feedback systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a design course, you already have, or are developing, the skills that open-source projects need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open design is an opportunity to develop by collaborating across disciplines, navigating ambiguity, and advocating for users: skills employers value. With open design, you’ll gain confidence in presenting ideas, working with international teams, and handling feedback in a real-world setting, growing in ways that classroom projects and internships often don’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re aiming for a tech-focused design career, open design is one of the most impactful and distinctive ways to stand out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started is easier than you think, even if GitHub looks scary at first. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the basics of GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve made a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rIN3Tr1xRIw?si=WqMUIKZ3RrbGwUh2"&gt;video guide to understanding GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and curated a list of other &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sy-KSbA3WATYD20lWXOcRLIGxLOTJjZKDUhpNn-shZA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.cdj6wh5znx6k"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; to get to grips with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a project on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://contribute.design/for-designers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contribute.design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a job board for design contributions. These projects are waiting for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the project’s needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects on &lt;a href="https://contribute.design/for-designers"&gt;contribute.design&lt;/a&gt; list what they’re looking for in .design file or DESIGN.md guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick an issue, or propose your own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the Issues tab of the project repo, where you can filter for issues labelled for design. You can also use this tab to propose any issues you discover in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute, collaborate, grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start adding your ideas, questions, and solutions to issues. You’ll be collaborating, communicating, and making meaningful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can explore more projects through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/explore"&gt;GitHub Explore&lt;/a&gt; page, but not every project will have a design process in place; that’s where your skills are especially valuable. If you don’t see design issues, treat the project as a blank canvas. Suggest checklists, organise a design system, or improve documentation. The power is in your hands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out to maintainers, join community discussions, and don’t hesitate to introduce design-focused thinking. Your initiative can spark meaningful change and help open source become more user-friendly, one project at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View every project as an opportunity; you don’t need an invitation to contribute, just curiosity, creativity, and the willingness to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interested? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for universities and departments interested in introducing open design to their students. Whether that’s through a talk, module project briefs, or anything else you’d like to see, we’re excited to find ways to work together and bring open design to campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a program director, a design department, a student group, or an interested student? Let’s talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out at &lt;a href="mailto:opendesign@canonical.com"&gt;opendesign@canonical.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Android device simulation, smarter diagnostics, and OIDC-enforced authentication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anbox Cloud team has been working around the clock to release Anbox Cloud 1.28.0! We’re very proud of this release that adds robust authentication, improved diagnostic tools, and expanded simulation options, making Anbox Cloud even more secure, flexible, and developer-friendly for running large-scale Android workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go over the most significant changes in this new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Strengthened authentication and authorization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based authentication and authorization framework is now stable with Anbox Cloud 1.28.0. This new framework provides a standardized approach for controlling access across web and command-line clients. Operators can now assign permissions through entitlements with fine-grained control, define authorization groups, and create and manage identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring user permissions, understanding the idea of identities and groups, and looking through the entire list of available entitlements are all thoroughly covered in the &lt;a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/anbox/auth/#howto-auth"&gt;new guides&lt;/a&gt; that come with this release. This represents a significant advancement in the direction of a more uniform and standards-based access model for all Anbox Cloud deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Simulated SMS support&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of our most exciting new features: developers testing telephony-enabled applications in Anbox Cloud can now simulate incoming SMS messages using the Anbox runtime HTTP API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new functionality allows messages to trigger notifications the same way they would on a physical device, generating more realistic end-to-end scenarios. A &lt;a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/android/simulate-incoming-sms/#howto-simulate-incoming-sms"&gt;new how-to guide&lt;/a&gt; in our documentation provides detailed instructions on how to enable and use this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protection against accidental deletions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know accidents happen (especially in production environments…), in order to reduce operational risk, this release introduces the ability to protect instances from accidental deletion. This option can be enabled directly in the dashboard either when creating a new instance or later from the Instance details page under the Security section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this protection option is turned on, the instance cannot be deleted, even during bulk delete operations, until the configuration is reset. This simple safeguard helps operators preserve important data and prevents costly mistakes in busy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Improved ADB share management&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with ADB (the Android Debug Bridge) has also become more flexible. Anbox Cloud now allows up to five ADB shares to be managed directly from the dashboard. For those who prefer the command line, the new amc connect command provides an alternative to the existing anbox-connect tool. Together, these improvements make it easier for developers to manage and maintain multiple debugging or testing sessions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New diagnostic facility for troubleshooting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With version 1.28.0, we’re introducing a new diagnostic facility in the dashboard. This tool is designed to simplify troubleshooting for both the instances and the streaming sessions themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature helps collect relevant diagnostic data automatically, thereby reducing the work needed to identify and resolve issues. It also makes collaboration with our Canonical support teams more efficient, as users can now provide consistent and accurate diagnostic information in a structured, standard format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sensor support in the Streaming SDK&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another hotly anticipated feature: the Anbox Streaming SDK gains expanded sensor support in this release. Our SDK now includes gyroscope, accelerometer and orientation sensors, allowing developers to test applications more interactively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensor support is disabled by default but can be easily enabled in the streaming client configuration. This addition opens up new possibilities for interactive use cases, such as gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Upgrade now and stay tuned!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that Anbox Cloud 1.28.0 is our best release to date, and we are pleased to keep providing a feature-rich, scalable, and safe solution for managing Android workloads on a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest version makes it easier than ever for developers and operators to create and test Android apps by introducing more precise device simulation, improved troubleshooting tools, and stricter access controls, as we’ve explained above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it now and stay tuned for further developments in our upcoming releases. For detailed instructions on how to upgrade your existing deployment, please refer to the &lt;a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/howto/update/upgrade-anbox/#howto-upgrade-anbox-cloud"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Linux Foundation report reveals how organizations worldwide are adopting, using, and perceiving open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation’s latest &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/world-of-open-source-global-2025"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The state of global open source&lt;/em&gt;, has just been released in collaboration with Canonical. The report follows &lt;a href="https://canonical.com/blog/open-source-advantage-europe"&gt;the Linux Foundation’s European spotlight report&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year, and confirms that many of the trends the European spotlight report unveiled are true on a global scale. In particular, the global spotlight report confirms the role of open source software as the foundation of business-critical systems worldwide, and indicates a continued increase in adoption. However, organizations continue to lack the governance, security testing, and strategic maturity required to manage open source strategically and securely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report suggests that most organizations expect enterprise-grade performance from open source software, but under-invest in the required governance frameworks, security practices, and community engagement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/engage/world-of-open-source-global-2025"&gt;&lt;button class="p-button--positive"&gt;Download the report&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;83% of organizations acknowledge open source is valuable to their future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, the trend of increasing open source adoption in the enterprise is set to continue, as 83% of enterprises consider open source software adoption valuable to their future. Likewise, the report reveals the centrality of open source software to the modern enterprise. Globally, enterprises have adopted open source software throughout their technical stacks: 55% have adopted open source operating systems, whilst 49% have adopted open source cloud and container technologies, and 46% open source web and application development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread confidence that open source will play a pivotal role in many organizations’ futures is closely connected to a growing understanding of the benefits of open source software adoption.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;86% report open source software improves productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report confirms a shift in enterprises’ strategic mindset around open source: 82% of respondents considered open source as an asset that enables innovation. Historically, open source software was often reserved for specific projects or use cases, like setting up web servers – with wider organizational use being viewed with some scepticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is now a “must-have.” Why is this the case? Here’s what the respondents had to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;86% stated that open source improves productivity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;79% reported improved software quality as a result of open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;78% highlighted improved security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="701" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 1180px, 100vw" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1180/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_460/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_620/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1036/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 1036w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1681/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 1681w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1920/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 1920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_1180/https%3A%2F%2Fubuntu.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F9d4b%2FGraph-Linux-Foundation-2025-World-of-Open-Source-Global-Report.png 1180w" width="1180"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the benefits seen by organizations using open source software in 2024, 46% reported increased business value from open source over the past year. The growing interest in and use of open source technologies is particularly clear for certain technologies, like AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI technologies benefit most from being open source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing value of open source can partly be attributed to the influence of AI. Since 2024, there has been an increase in the adoption of open source AI and machine learning (ML) applications from 35% to 40% – a rise of 5%. Globally, AI and ML were perceived to be the technology most benefiting from being open source. Code visibility ensures organizations can more easily audit their AI systems, which makes compliance simpler, provides more transparency into how the AI model functions, and enables companies to run the AI on their own infrastructure – ensuring sensitive data never leaves the organization’s control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With growing adoption of AI and ML come new cybersecurity risks and requirements. However, the report indicates that organizations currently lack mature governance structures for their open source estates, creating additional complications to adopting AI and ML securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lack of mature governance: only 34% of organizations have defined a clear open source strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite increasing adoption of open source technologies, many organizations still lack a mature governance strategy for their open source software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of organizations that have defined a clear open source strategy has grown by just 2% in the last year, to a total of 34%. That means that nearly two-thirds of organizations rely instead on informal strategies of governance of their open source estates, primarily due to budget constraints, shifting priorities and new strategic requirements. For example, when evaluating open source components for adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44% of organizations check the activity level of the project community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;31% use automated security testing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28% manually review the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36% evaluate the direct dependencies of the open source component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With less than half of organizations taking these important formal strategies before adoption, the report indicates that this “creates significant risk exposure and limits organizations’ ability to capture the full strategic value of open source participation,” signalling that this is a concern that organizations must take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, organizations demonstrate a lack of consensus around which security features and assurances matter to them when adopting open source components, with no single certification or assurance mechanism achieving adoption by more than a quarter of open source solutions. Almost a third of organizations (28%) don’t know which assurances would make them more likely to trust an open source solution. This opens them up to serious security risks, like supply chain attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, enterprises are increasingly turning to paid support options for their open source estates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;54% view paid support as essential for mission-critical workloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of respondents consider paid support for their open source essential. As open source technologies have become critical to business infrastructure, expectations for open source software support are beginning to mirror that of commercial software standards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;71% of organizations expect response times of less than 12 hours from support providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% expect rapid security patching for open source software in production environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;53% expect long term support guarantees for their open source software. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring paid support for open source software makes this level of support achievable, which organizations broadly accept. On a granular level, the industries with the highest proportion that consider paid support essential are those that process sensitive or valuable data, such as manufacturing (97%) followed by financial services (96%), IT (91%) and government (92%). &lt;/p&gt;
